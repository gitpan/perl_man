.SH "NAME"
perldebug \- Perl debugging
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
First of all, have you tried using the \fB\-w\fR switch?
.SH "The Perl Debugger"
\*(L"As soon as we started programming, we found to our
surprise that it wasn't as easy to get programs right
as we had thought.  Debugging had to be discovered.
I can remember the exact instant when I realized that
a large part of my life from then on was going to be
spent in finding mistakes in my own programs.\*(R"
.PP
\fI  --Maurice Wilkes, 1949\fR
.PP
If you invoke Perl with the \fB\-d\fR switch, your script runs under the
Perl source debugger.  This works like an interactive Perl
environment, prompting for debugger commands that let you examine
source code, set breakpoints, get stack backtraces, change the values of
variables, etc.  This is so convenient that you often fire up
the debugger all by itself just to test out Perl constructs
interactively to see what they do.  For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    perl -d -e 42
.Ve
In Perl, the debugger is not a separate program as it usually is in the
typical compiled environment.  Instead, the \fB\-d\fR flag tells the compiler
to insert source information into the parse trees it's about to hand off
to the interpreter.  That means your code must first compile correctly
for the debugger to work on it.  Then when the interpreter starts up, it
preloads a Perl library file containing the debugger itself.
.PP
The program will halt \fIright before\fR the first run-time executable
statement (but see below regarding compile-time statements) and ask you
to enter a debugger command.  Contrary to popular expectations, whenever
the debugger halts and shows you a line of code, it always displays the
line it's \fIabout\fR to execute, rather than the one it has just executed.
.PP
Any command not recognized by the debugger is directly executed
(\f(CWeval\fR'd) as Perl code in the current package.  (The debugger uses the
DB package for its own state information.)
.PP
Leading white space before a command would cause the debugger to think
it's \fINOT\fR a debugger command but for Perl, so be careful not to do
that.
.Sh "Debugger Commands"
The debugger understands the following commands:
.Ip "h [command]" 12
Prints out a help message.
.Sp
If you supply another debugger command as an argument to the \f(CWh\fR command,
it prints out the description for just that command.  The special
argument of \f(CWh h\fR produces a more compact help listing, designed to fit
together on one screen.
.Sp
If the output of the \f(CWh\fR command (or any command, for that matter) scrolls
past your screen, either precede the command with a leading pipe symbol so
it's run through your pager, as in
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    DB> |h
.Ve
You may change the pager which is used via \f(CWO pager=...\fR command.
.Ip "p expr" 12
Same as \f(CWprint {$DB::OUT} expr\fR in the current package.  In particular,
because this is just Perl's own \fBprint\fR function, this means that nested
data structures and objects are not dumped, unlike with the \f(CWx\fR command.
.Sp
The \f(CWDB::OUT\fR filehandle is opened to \fI/dev/tty\fR, regardless of
where \s-1STDOUT\s0 may be redirected to.
.Ip "x expr" 12
Evaluates its expression in list context and dumps out the result
in a pretty-printed fashion.  Nested data structures are printed out
recursively, unlike the \f(CWprint\fR function.
.Sp
The details of printout are governed by multiple \f(CWO\fRptions.
.Ip "V [pkg [vars]]" 12
Display all (or some) variables in package (defaulting to the \f(CWmain\fR
package) using a data pretty-printer (hashes show their keys and values so
you see what's what, control characters are made printable, etc.).  Make
sure you don't put the type specifier (like \f(CW$\fR) there, just the symbol
names, like this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    V DB filename line
.Ve
Use \f(CW~pattern\fR and \f(CW!pattern\fR for positive and negative regexps.
.Sp
Nested data structures are printed out in a legible fashion, unlike
the \f(CWprint\fR function.
.Sp
The details of printout are governed by multiple \f(CWO\fRptions.
.Ip "X [vars]" 12
Same as \f(CWV currentpackage [vars]\fR.
.Ip "T" 12
Produce a stack backtrace.  See below for details on its output.
.Ip "s [expr]" 12
Single step.  Executes until it reaches the beginning of another
statement, descending into subroutine calls.  If an expression is
supplied that includes function calls, it too will be single-stepped.
.Ip "n [expr]" 12
Next.  Executes over subroutine calls, until it reaches the beginning
of the next statement.  If an expression is supplied that includes
function calls, those functions will be executed with stops before
each statement.
.Ip "<\s-1CR\s0>" 12
Repeat last \f(CWn\fR or \f(CWs\fR command.
.Ip "c [line|sub]" 12
Continue, optionally inserting a one-time-only breakpoint
at the specified line or subroutine.
.Ip "l" 12
List next window of lines.
.Ip "l min+incr" 12
List \f(CWincr+1\fR lines starting at \f(CWmin\fR.
.Ip "l min-max" 12
List lines \f(CWmin\fR through \f(CWmax\fR.  \f(CWl -\fR is synonymous to \f(CW-\fR.
.Ip "l line" 12
List a single line.
.Ip "l subname" 12
List first window of lines from subroutine.
.Ip "-" 12
List previous window of lines.
.Ip "w [line]" 12
List window (a few lines) around the current line.
.Ip "." 12
Return debugger pointer to the last-executed line and
print it out.
.Ip "f filename" 12
Switch to viewing a different file or eval statement.  If \f(CWfilename\fR
is not a full filename as found in values of \f(CW%INC\fR, it is considered as
a regexp.
.Ip "/pattern/" 12
Search forwards for pattern; final / is optional.
.Ip "?pattern?" 12
Search backwards for pattern; final ? is optional.
.Ip "L" 12
List all breakpoints and actions.
.Ip "S [[!]pattern]" 12
List subroutine names [not] matching pattern.
.Ip "t" 12
Toggle trace mode (see also \f(CWAutoTrace\fR \f(CWO\fRption).
.Ip "t expr" 12
Trace through execution of expr.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\& $ perl -de 42
\& Stack dump during die enabled outside of evals.
.Ve
.Vb 2
\& Loading DB routines from perl5db.pl patch level 0.94
\& Emacs support available.
.Ve
.Vb 1
\& Enter h or `h h' for help.
.Ve
.Vb 2
\& main::(-e:1):   0
\&   DB<1> sub foo { 14 }
.Ve
.Vb 1
\&   DB<2> sub bar { 3 }
.Ve
.Vb 5
\&   DB<3> t print foo() * bar()
\& main::((eval 172):3):   print foo() + bar();
\& main::foo((eval 168):2):
\& main::bar((eval 170):2):
\& 42
.Ve
or, with the \f(CWO\fRption \f(CWframe=2\fR set,
.Sp
.Vb 11
\&   DB<4> O f=2
\&                frame = '2'
\&   DB<5> t print foo() * bar()
\& 3:      foo() * bar()
\& entering main::foo
\&  2:     sub foo { 14 };
\& exited main::foo
\& entering main::bar
\&  2:     sub bar { 3 };
\& exited main::bar
\& 42
.Ve
.Ip "b [line] [condition]" 12
Set a breakpoint.  If line is omitted, sets a breakpoint on the line
that is about to be executed.  If a condition is specified, it's
evaluated each time the statement is reached and a breakpoint is taken
only if the condition is true.  Breakpoints may be set on only lines
that begin an executable statement.  Conditions don't use \fBif\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    b 237 $x > 30
\&    b 237 ++$count237 < 11
\&    b 33 /pattern/i
.Ve
.Ip "b subname [condition]" 12
Set a breakpoint at the first line of the named subroutine.
.Ip "b postpone subname [condition]" 12
Set breakpoint at first line of subroutine after it is compiled.
.Ip "b load filename" 12
Set breakpoint at the first executed line of the file.  Filename should
be a full name as found in values of \f(CW%INC\fR.
.Ip "b compile subname" 12
Sets breakpoint at the first statement executed after the subroutine
is compiled.
.Ip "d [line]" 12
Delete a breakpoint at the specified line.  If line is omitted, deletes
the breakpoint on the line that is about to be executed.
.Ip "D" 12
Delete all installed breakpoints.
.Ip "a [line] command" 12
Set an action to be done before the line is executed.
The sequence of steps taken by the debugger is
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&  1. check for a breakpoint at this line
\&  2. print the line if necessary (tracing)
\&  3. do any actions associated with that line
\&  4. prompt user if at a breakpoint or in single-step
\&  5. evaluate line
.Ve
For example, this will print out \f(CW$foo\fR every time line
53 is passed:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    a 53 print "DB FOUND $foo\en"
.Ve
.Ip "A" 12
Delete all installed actions.
.Ip "W [expr]" 12
Add a global watch-expression.
.Ip "W" 12
Delete all watch-expressions.
.Ip "O [opt[=val]] [op'val' [opt?]..." 12
Set or query values of options.  val defaults to 1.  opt can
be abbreviated.  Several options can be listed.
.Ip "\f(CWrecallCommand\fR, \f(CWShellBang\fR" 24
The characters used to recall command or spawn shell.  By
default, these are both set to \f(CW!\fR.
.Ip "\f(CWpager\fR" 24
Program to use for output of pager-piped commands (those
beginning with a \f(CW|\fR character.)  By default,
\f(CW$ENV{PAGER}\fR will be used.
.Ip "\f(CWtkRunning\fR" 24
Run Tk while prompting (with ReadLine).
.Ip "\f(CWsignalLevel\fR, \f(CWwarnLevel\fR, \f(CWdieLevel\fR" 24
Level of verbosity.  By default the debugger is in a sane verbose mode,
thus it will print backtraces on all the warnings and die-messages
which are going to be printed out, and will print a message when
interesting uncaught signals arrive.
.Sp
To disable this behaviour, set these values to 0.  If \f(CWdieLevel\fR is 2,
then the messages which will be caught by surrounding \f(CWeval\fR are also
printed.
.Ip "\f(CWAutoTrace\fR" 24
Trace mode (similar to \f(CWt\fR command, but can be put into
\f(CWPERLDB_OPTS\fR).
.Ip "\f(CWLineInfo\fR" 24
File or pipe to print line number info to.  If it is a pipe (say,
\f(CW|visual_perl_db\fR), then a short, \*(L"emacs like\*(R" message is used.
.Ip "\f(CWinhibit_exit\fR" 24
If 0, allows \fIstepping off\fR the end of the script.
.Ip "\f(CWPrintRet\fR" 24
affects printing of return value after \f(CWr\fR command.
.Ip "\f(CWornaments\fR" 24
affects screen appearance of the command line (see the \fITerm::ReadLine\fR manpage).
.Ip "\f(CWframe\fR" 24
affects printing messages on entry and exit from subroutines.  If
\f(CWframe & 2\fR is false, messages are printed on entry only. (Printing
on exit may be useful if \fIinter\fR\|(di)spersed with other messages.)
.Sp
If \f(CWframe & 4\fR, arguments to functions are printed as well as the
context and caller info.  If \f(CWframe & 8\fR, overloaded \f(CWstringify\fR and
\f(CWtie\fRd \f(CWFETCH\fR are enabled on the printed arguments. If \f(CWframe &
16\fR, the return value from the subroutine is printed as well.
.Sp
The length at which the argument list is truncated is governed by the
next option:
.Ip "\f(CWmaxTraceLen\fR" 24
length at which the argument list is truncated when \f(CWframe\fR option's
bit 4 is set.
.Sp
The following options affect what happens with \f(CWV\fR, \f(CWX\fR, and \f(CWx\fR
commands:
.Ip "\f(CWarrayDepth\fR, \f(CWhashDepth\fR" 24
Print only first N elements ('\*(R' for all).
.Ip "\f(CWcompactDump\fR, \f(CWveryCompact\fR" 24
Change style of array and hash dump.  If \f(CWcompactDump\fR, short array
may be printed on one line.
.Ip "\f(CWglobPrint\fR" 24
Whether to print contents of globs.
.Ip "\f(CWDumpDBFiles\fR" 24
Dump arrays holding debugged files.
.Ip "\f(CWDumpPackages\fR" 24
Dump symbol tables of packages.
.Ip "\f(CWDumpReused\fR" 24
Dump contents of \*(L"reused\*(R" addresses.
.Ip "\f(CWquote\fR, \f(CWHighBit\fR, \f(CWundefPrint\fR" 24
Change style of string dump.  Default value of \f(CWquote\fR is \f(CWauto\fR, one
can enable either double-quotish dump, or single-quotish by setting it
to \f(CW"\fR or \f(CW'\fR.  By default, characters with high bit set are printed
\fIas is\fR.
.Ip "\f(CWUsageOnly\fR" 24
\fIvery\fR rudimentally per-package memory usage dump.  Calculates total
size of strings in variables in the package.
.Sp
During startup options are initialized from \f(CW$ENV{PERLDB_OPTS}\fR.
You can put additional initialization options \f(CWTTY\fR, \f(CWnoTTY\fR,
\f(CWReadLine\fR, and \f(CWNonStop\fR there.
.Sp
Example rc file:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  &parse_options("NonStop=1 LineInfo=db.out AutoTrace");
.Ve
The script will run without human intervention, putting trace information
into the file \fIdb.out\fR.  (If you interrupt it, you would better reset
\f(CWLineInfo\fR to something \*(L"interactive\*(R"!)
.Ip "\f(CWTTY\fR" 24
The \s-1TTY\s0 to use for debugging I/O.
.Ip "\f(CWnoTTY\fR" 24
If set, goes in \f(CWNonStop\fR mode, and would not connect to a \s-1TTY\s0.  If
interrupt (or if control goes to debugger via explicit setting of
\f(CW$DB::signal\fR or \f(CW$DB::single\fR from the Perl script), connects to a \s-1TTY\s0
specified by the \f(CWTTY\fR option at startup, or to a \s-1TTY\s0 found at
runtime using \f(CWTerm::Rendezvous\fR module of your choice.
.Sp
This module should implement a method \f(CWnew\fR which returns an object
with two methods: \f(CWIN\fR and \f(CWOUT\fR, returning two filehandles to use
for debugging input and output correspondingly.  Method \f(CWnew\fR may
inspect an argument which is a value of \f(CW$ENV{PERLDB_NOTTY}\fR at
startup, or is \f(CW"/tmp/perldbtty$$"\fR otherwise.
.Ip "\f(CWReadLine\fR" 24
If false, readline support in debugger is disabled, so you can debug
ReadLine applications.
.Ip "\f(CWNonStop\fR" 24
If set, debugger goes into noninteractive mode until interrupted, or
programmatically by setting \f(CW$DB::signal\fR or \f(CW$DB::single\fR.
.Sp
Here's an example of using the \f(CW$ENV{PERLDB_OPTS}\fR variable:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  $ PERLDB_OPTS="N f=2" perl -d myprogram
.Ve
will run the script \f(CWmyprogram\fR without human intervention, printing
out the call tree with entry and exit points.  Note that \f(CWN f=2\fR is
equivalent to \f(CWNonStop=1 frame=2\fR.  Note also that at the moment when
this documentation was written all the options to the debugger could
be uniquely abbreviated by the first letter (with exception of
\f(CWDump*\fR options).
.Sp
Other examples may include
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  $ PERLDB_OPTS="N f A L=listing" perl -d myprogram
.Ve
- runs script noninteractively, printing info on each entry into a
subroutine and each executed line into the file \fIlisting\fR. (If you
interrupt it, you would better reset \f(CWLineInfo\fR to something
\*(L"interactive\*(R"!)
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  $ env "PERLDB_OPTS=R=0 TTY=/dev/ttyc" perl -d myprogram
.Ve
may be useful for debugging a program which uses \f(CWTerm::ReadLine\fR
itself.  Do not forget detach shell from the \s-1TTY\s0 in the window which
corresponds to \fI/dev/ttyc\fR, say, by issuing a command like
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  $ sleep 1000000
.Ve
See the section on \fIDebugger Internals\fR below for more details.
.Ip "< [ command ]" 12
Set an action (Perl command) to happen before every debugger prompt.
A multi-line command may be entered by backslashing the newlines.  If
\f(CWcommand\fR is missing, resets the list of actions.
.Ip "<< command" 12
Add an action (Perl command) to happen before every debugger prompt.
A multi-line command may be entered by backslashing the newlines.
.Ip "> command" 12
Set an action (Perl command) to happen after the prompt when you've
just given a command to return to executing the script.  A multi-line
command may be entered by backslashing the newlines.  If \f(CWcommand\fR is
missing, resets the list of actions.
.Ip ">> command" 12
Adds an action (Perl command) to happen after the prompt when you've
just given a command to return to executing the script.  A multi-line
command may be entered by backslashing the newlines.
.Ip "{ [ command ]" 12
Set an action (debugger command) to happen before every debugger prompt.
A multi-line command may be entered by backslashing the newlines.  If
\f(CWcommand\fR is missing, resets the list of actions.
.Ip "{{ command" 12
Add an action (debugger command) to happen before every debugger prompt.
A multi-line command may be entered by backslashing the newlines.
.Ip "! number" 12
Redo a previous command (default previous command).
.Ip "! \-number" 12
Redo number'th-to-last command.
.Ip "! pattern" 12
Redo last command that started with pattern.
See \f(CWO recallCommand\fR, too.
.Ip "!! cmd" 12
Run cmd in a subprocess (reads from \s-1DB::IN\s0, writes to \s-1DB::OUT\s0)
See \f(CWO shellBang\fR too.
.Ip "H \-number" 12
Display last n commands.  Only commands longer than one character are
listed.  If number is omitted, lists them all.
.Ip "q or ^D" 12
Quit.  ("quit\*(R" doesn't work for this.)  This is the only supported way
to exit the debugger, though typing \f(CWexit\fR twice may do it too.
.Sp
Set an \f(CWO\fRption \f(CWinhibit_exit\fR to 0 if you want to be able to \fIstep
off\fR the end the script.  You may also need to set \f(CW$finished\fR to 0 at
some moment if you want to step through global destruction.
.Ip "R" 12
Restart the debugger by \fBexec\fRing a new session.  It tries to maintain
your history across this, but internal settings and command line options
may be lost.
.Sp
Currently the following setting are preserved: history, breakpoints,
actions, debugger \f(CWO\fRptions, and the following command line
options: \fB\-w\fR, \fB\-I\fR, and \fB\-e\fR.
.Ip "|dbcmd" 12
Run debugger command, piping \s-1DB::OUT\s0 to current pager.
.Ip "||dbcmd" 12
Same as \f(CW|dbcmd\fR but \s-1DB::OUT\s0 is temporarily \fBselect\fRed as well.
Often used with commands that would otherwise produce long
output, such as
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    |V main
.Ve
.Ip "= [alias value]" 12
Define a command alias, like
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    = quit q
.Ve
or list current aliases.
.Ip "command" 12
Execute command as a Perl statement.  A missing semicolon will be
supplied.
.Ip "m expr" 12
The expression is evaluated, and the methods which may be applied to
the result are listed.
.Ip "m package" 12
The methods which may be applied to objects in the \f(CWpackage\fR are listed.
.Sh "Debugger input/output"
.Ip "Prompt" 8
The debugger prompt is something like
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    DB<8>
.Ve
or even
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    DB<<17>>
.Ve
where that number is the command number, which you'd use to access with
the builtin \fBcsh\fR\-like history mechanism, e.g., \f(CW!17\fR would repeat
command number 17.  The number of angle brackets indicates the depth of
the debugger.  You could get more than one set of brackets, for example, if
you'd already at a breakpoint and then printed out the result of a
function call that itself also has a breakpoint, or you step into an
expression via \f(CWs/n/t expression\fR command.
.Ip "Multiline commands" 8
If you want to enter a multi-line command, such as a subroutine
definition with several statements, or a format, you may escape the
newline that would normally end the debugger command with a backslash.
Here's an example:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&      DB<1> for (1..4) {         \e
\&      cont:     print "ok\en";   \e
\&      cont: }
\&      ok
\&      ok
\&      ok
\&      ok
.Ve
Note that this business of escaping a newline is specific to interactive
commands typed into the debugger.
.Ip "Stack backtrace" 8
Here's an example of what a stack backtrace via \f(CWT\fR command might
look like:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    $ = main::infested called from file `Ambulation.pm' line 10
\&    @ = Ambulation::legs(1, 2, 3, 4) called from file `camel_flea' line 7
\&    $ = main::pests('bactrian', 4) called from file `camel_flea' line 4
.Ve
The left-hand character up there tells whether the function was called
in a scalar or list context (we bet you can tell which is which).  What
that says is that you were in the function \f(CWmain::infested\fR when you ran
the stack dump, and that it was called in a scalar context from line 10
of the file \fIAmbulation.pm\fR, but without any arguments at all, meaning
it was called as \f(CW&infested\fR.  The next stack frame shows that the
function \f(CWAmbulation::legs\fR was called in a list context from the
\fIcamel_flea\fR file with four arguments.  The last stack frame shows that
\f(CWmain::pests\fR was called in a scalar context, also from \fIcamel_flea\fR,
but from line 4.
.Sp
Note that if you execute \f(CWT\fR command from inside an active \f(CWuse\fR
statement, the backtrace will contain both \f(CWrequire\fR
frame and an \f(CWeval\fR) frame.
.Ip "Listing" 8
Listing given via different flavors of \f(CWl\fR command looks like this:
.Sp
.Vb 11
\&    DB<<13>> l
\&  101:                @i{@i} = ();
\&  102:b               @isa{@i,$pack} = ()
\&  103                     if(exists $i{$prevpack} || exists $isa{$pack});
\&  104             }
\&  105
\&  106             next
\&  107==>              if(exists $isa{$pack});
\&  108
\&  109:a           if ($extra-- > 0) {
\&  110:                %isa = ($pack,1);
.Ve
Note that the breakable lines are marked with \f(CW:\fR, lines with
breakpoints are marked by \f(CWb\fR, with actions by \f(CWa\fR, and the
next executed line is marked by \f(CW==>\fR.
.Ip "Frame listing" 8
When \f(CWframe\fR option is set, debugger would print entered (and
optionally exited) subroutines in different styles.
.Sp
What follows is the start of the listing of
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  env "PERLDB_OPTS=f=n N" perl -d -V
.Ve
for different values of \f(CWn\fR:

In all the cases indentation of lines shows the call tree, if bit 2 of
\f(CWframe\fR is set, then a line is printed on exit from a subroutine as
well, if bit 4 is set, then the arguments are printed as well as the
caller info, if bit 8 is set, the arguments are printed even if they
are tied or references, if bit 16 is set, the return value is printed
as well.
.Sp
When a package is compiled, a line like this
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    Package lib/Carp.pm.
.Ve
is printed with proper indentation.
.Sh "Debugging compile-time statements"
If you have any compile-time executable statements (code within a \s-1BEGIN\s0
block or a \f(CWuse\fR statement), these will \f(CWNOT\fR be stopped by debugger,
although \f(CWrequire\fRs will (and compile-time statements can be traced
with \f(CWAutoTrace\fR option set in \f(CWPERLDB_OPTS\fR).  From your own Perl
code, however, you can
transfer control back to the debugger using the following statement,
which is harmless if the debugger is not running:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $DB::single = 1;
.Ve
If you set \f(CW$DB::single\fR to the value 2, it's equivalent to having
just typed the \f(CWn\fR command, whereas a value of 1 means the \f(CWs\fR
command.  The \f(CW$DB::trace\fR  variable should be set to 1 to simulate
having typed the \f(CWt\fR command.
.PP
Another way to debug compile-time code is to start debugger, set a
breakpoint on \fIload\fR of some module thusly
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    DB<7> b load f:/perllib/lib/Carp.pm
\&  Will stop on load of `f:/perllib/lib/Carp.pm'.
.Ve
and restart debugger by \f(CWR\fR command (if possible).  One can use \f(CWb
compile subname\fR for the same purpose.
.Sh "Debugger Customization"
Most probably you do not want to modify the debugger, it contains enough
hooks to satisfy most needs.  You may change the behaviour of debugger
from the debugger itself, using \f(CWO\fRptions, from the command line via
\f(CWPERLDB_OPTS\fR environment variable, and from \fIcustomization files\fR.
.PP
You can do some customization by setting up a \fI.perldb\fR file which
contains initialization code.  For instance, you could make aliases
like these (the last one is one people expect to be there):
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    $DB::alias{'len'}  = 's/^len(.*)/p length($1)/';
\&    $DB::alias{'stop'} = 's/^stop (at|in)/b/';
\&    $DB::alias{'ps'}   = 's/^ps\eb/p scalar /';
\&    $DB::alias{'quit'} = 's/^quit(\es*)/exit\e$/';
.Ve
One changes options from \fI.perldb\fR file via calls like this one;
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    parse_options("NonStop=1 LineInfo=db.out AutoTrace=1 frame=2");
.Ve
(the code is executed in the package \f(CWDB\fR).  Note that \fI.perldb\fR is
processed before processing \f(CWPERLDB_OPTS\fR.  If \fI.perldb\fR defines the
subroutine \f(CWafterinit\fR, it is called after all the debugger
initialization ends.  \fI.perldb\fR may be contained in the current
directory, or in the \f(CWLOGDIR\fR/\f(CWHOME\fR directory.
.PP
If you want to modify the debugger, copy \fIperl5db.pl\fR from the Perl
library to another name and modify it as necessary.  You'll also want
to set your \f(CWPERL5DB\fR environment variable to say something like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    BEGIN { require "myperl5db.pl" }
.Ve
As the last resort, one can use \f(CWPERL5DB\fR to customize debugger by
directly setting internal variables or calling debugger functions.
.Sh "Readline Support"
As shipped, the only command line history supplied is a simplistic one
that checks for leading exclamation points.  However, if you install
the Term::ReadKey and Term::ReadLine modules from \s-1CPAN\s0, you will
have full editing capabilities much like \s-1GNU\s0 \fIreadline\fR(3) provides.
Look for these in the \fImodules/by-module/Term\fR directory on \s-1CPAN\s0.
.PP
A rudimentary command line completion is also available.
Unfortunately, the names of lexical variables are not available for
completion.
.Sh "Editor Support for Debugging"
If you have \s-1GNU\s0 \fBemacs\fR installed on your system, it can interact with
the Perl debugger to provide an integrated software development
environment reminiscent of its interactions with C debuggers.
.PP
Perl is also delivered with a start file for making \fBemacs\fR act like a
syntax-directed editor that understands (some of) Perl's syntax.  Look in
the \fIemacs\fR directory of the Perl source distribution.
.PP
(Historically, a similar setup for interacting with \fBvi\fR and the
X11 window system had also been available, but at the time of this
writing, no debugger support for \fBvi\fR currently exists.)
.Sh "The Perl Profiler"
If you wish to supply an alternative debugger for Perl to run, just
invoke your script with a colon and a package argument given to the \fB\-d\fR
flag.  One of the most popular alternative debuggers for Perl is
\fBDProf\fR, the Perl profiler.   As of this writing, \fBDProf\fR is not
included with the standard Perl distribution, but it is expected to
be included soon, for certain values of \*(L"soon\*(R".
.PP
Meanwhile, you can fetch the Devel::Dprof module from \s-1CPAN\s0.  Assuming
it's properly installed on your system, to profile your Perl program in
the file \fImycode.pl\fR, just type:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    perl -d:DProf mycode.pl
.Ve
When the script terminates the profiler will dump the profile information
to a file called \fItmon.out\fR.  A tool like \fBdprofpp\fR (also supplied with
the Devel::DProf package) can be used to interpret the information which is
in that profile.
.Sh "Debugger support in perl"
When you call the \fBcaller\fR function (see the \f(CWcaller\fR entry in the \fIperlfunc\fR manpage) from the
package \s-1DB\s0, Perl sets the array \f(CW@DB::args\fR to contain the arguments the
corresponding stack frame was called with.
.PP
If perl is run with \fB\-d\fR option, the following additional features
are enabled (cf. the section on \fI$^P\fR in the \fIperlvar\fR manpage):
.Ip "\(bu" 5
Perl inserts the contents of \f(CW$ENV{PERL5DB}\fR (or \f(CWBEGIN {require
\&'perl5db.pl'}\fR if not present) before the first line of the
application.
.Ip "\(bu" 5
The array \f(CW@{"_<$filename"}\fR is the line-by-line contents of
\f(CW$filename\fR for all the compiled files.  Same for \f(CWeval\fRed strings which
contain subroutines, or which are currently executed.  The \f(CW$filename\fR
for \f(CWeval\fRed strings looks like \f(CW(eval 34)\fR.
.Ip "\(bu" 5
The hash \f(CW%{"_<$filename"}\fR contains breakpoints and action (it is
keyed by line number), and individual entries are settable (as opposed
to the whole hash).  Only true/false is important to Perl, though the
values used by \fIperl5db.pl\fR have the form
\f(CW"$break_condition\e0$action"\fR.  Values are magical in numeric context:
they are zeros if the line is not breakable.
.Sp
Same for evaluated strings which contain subroutines, or which are
currently executed.  The \f(CW$filename\fR for \f(CWeval\fRed strings looks like
\f(CW(eval 34)\fR.
.Ip "\(bu" 5
The scalar \f(CW${"_<$filename"}\fR contains \f(CW"_<$filename"\fR.  Same for
evaluated strings which contain subroutines, or which are currently
executed.  The \f(CW$filename\fR for \f(CWeval\fRed strings looks like \f(CW(eval
34)\fR.
.Ip "\(bu" 5
After each \f(CWrequire\fRd file is compiled, but before it is executed,
\f(CWDB::postponed(*{"_<$filename"})\fR is called (if subroutine
\f(CWDB::postponed\fR exists).  Here the \f(CW$filename\fR is the expanded name of
the \f(CWrequire\fRd file (as found in values of \f(CW%INC\fR).
.Ip "\(bu" 5
After each subroutine \f(CWsubname\fR is compiled existence of
\f(CW$DB::postponed{subname}\fR is checked.  If this key exists,
\f(CWDB::postponed(subname)\fR is called (if subroutine \f(CWDB::postponed\fR
exists).
.Ip "\(bu" 5
A hash \f(CW%DB::sub\fR is maintained, with keys being subroutine names,
values having the form \f(CWfilename:startline-endline\fR.  \f(CWfilename\fR has
the form \f(CW(eval 31)\fR for subroutines defined inside \f(CWeval\fRs.
.Ip "\(bu" 5
When execution of the application reaches a place that can have
a breakpoint, a call to \f(CWDB::DB()\fR is performed if any one of
variables \f(CW$DB::trace\fR, \f(CW$DB::single\fR, or \f(CW$DB::signal\fR is true. (Note that
these variables are not \f(CWlocal\fRizable.) This feature is disabled when
the control is inside \f(CWDB::DB()\fR or functions called from it (unless
\f(CW$^D & (1<<30)\fR).
.Ip "\(bu" 5
When execution of the application reaches a subroutine call, a call
to \f(CW&DB::sub\fR(\fIargs\fR) is performed instead, with \f(CW$DB::sub\fR being
the name of the called subroutine. (Unless the subroutine is compiled
in the package \f(CWDB\fR.)
.PP
Note that if \f(CW&DB::sub\fR needs some external data to be setup for it
to work, no subroutine call is possible until this is done.  For the
standard debugger \f(CW$DB::deep\fR (how many levels of recursion deep into
the debugger you can go before a mandatory break) gives an example of
such a dependency.
.PP
The minimal working debugger consists of one line
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  sub DB::DB {}
.Ve
which is quite handy as contents of \f(CWPERL5DB\fR environment
variable:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  env "PERL5DB=sub DB::DB {}" perl -d your-script
.Ve
Another (a little bit more useful) minimal debugger can be created
with the only line being
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  sub DB::DB {print ++$i; scalar <STDIN>}
.Ve
This debugger would print the sequential number of encountered
statement, and would wait for your \f(CWCR\fR to continue.
.PP
The following debugger is quite functional:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&  {
\&    package DB;
\&    sub DB  {}
\&    sub sub {print ++$i, " $sub\en"; &$sub}
\&  }
.Ve
It prints the sequential number of subroutine call and the name of the
called subroutine.  Note that \f(CW&DB::sub\fR should be compiled into the
package \f(CWDB\fR.
.Sh "Debugger Internals"
At the start, the debugger reads your rc file (\fI./.perldb\fR or
\fI~/.perldb\fR under Unix), which can set important options.  This file may
define a subroutine \f(CW&afterinit\fR to be executed after the debugger is
initialized.
.PP
After the rc file is read, the debugger reads environment variable
\s-1PERLDB_OPTS\s0 and parses it as a rest of \f(CWO ...\fR line in debugger prompt.
.PP
It also maintains magical internal variables, such as \f(CW@DB::dbline\fR,
\f(CW%DB::dbline\fR, which are aliases for \f(CW@{"::_<current_file"}\fR
\f(CW%{"::_<current_file"}\fR.  Here \f(CWcurrent_file\fR is the currently
selected (with the debugger's \f(CWf\fR command, or by flow of execution)
file.
.PP
Some functions are provided to simplify customization.  See the section on \fIDebugger
Customization\fR for description of \f(CWDB::parse_options(string)\fR.  The
function \f(CWDB::dump_trace(skip[, count])\fR skips the specified number
of frames, and returns a list containing info about the caller
frames (all if \f(CWcount\fR is missing).  Each entry is a hash with keys
\f(CWcontext\fR (\f(CW$\fR or \f(CW@\fR), \f(CWsub\fR (subroutine name, or info about
eval), \f(CWargs\fR (\f(CWundef\fR or a reference to an array), \f(CWfile\fR, and
\f(CWline\fR.
.PP
The function \f(CWDB::print_trace(FH, skip[, count[, short]])\fR prints
formatted info about caller frames.  The last two functions may be
convenient as arguments to \f(CW<\fR, \f(CW<<\fR commands.
.Sh "Other resources"
You did try the \fB\-w\fR switch, didn't you?
.Sh "\s-1BUGS\s0"
You cannot get the stack frame information or otherwise debug functions
that were not compiled by Perl, such as C or \*(C+ extensions.
.PP
If you alter your \f(CW@_\fR arguments in a subroutine (such as with \fBshift\fR
or \fBpop\fR, the stack backtrace will not show the original values.
.SH "Debugging Perl memory usage"
Perl is \fIvery\fR frivolous with memory.  There is a saying that to
estimate memory usage of Perl, assume a reasonable algorithm of
allocation, and multiply your estimages by 10.  This is not absolutely
true, but may give you a good grasp of what happens.
.PP
Say, an integer cannot take less than 20 bytes of memory, a float
cannot take less than 24 bytes, a string cannot take less than 32
bytes (all these examples assume 32-bit architectures, the result are
much worse on 64-bit architectures).  If a variable is accessed in two
of three different ways (which require an integer, a float, or a
string), the memory footprint may increase by another 20 bytes.  A
sloppy \fImalloc()\fR implementation will make these numbers yet more.
.PP
On the opposite end of the scale, a declaration like
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  sub foo;
.Ve
may take (on some versions of perl) up to 500 bytes of memory.
.PP
Off-the-cuff anecdotal estimates of a code bloat give a factor around
8.  This means that the compiled form of reasonable (commented
indented etc.)  code will take approximately 8 times more than the
disk space the code takes.
.PP
There are two Perl-specific ways to analyze the memory usage:
\f(CW$ENV\fR{PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS} and \fB\-DL\fR switch.  First one is available
only if perl is compiled with Perl's \fImalloc()\fR, the second one only if
Perl compiled with \f(CW-DDEBUGGING\fR (as with giving \f(CW-D optimise=-g\fR
option to \fIConfigure\fR).
.Sh "Using \f(CW$ENV{PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS}\fR"
If your perl is using Perl's \fImalloc()\fR, and compiled with correct
switches (this is the default), then it will print memory usage
statistics after compiling your code (if \f(CW$ENV{PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS}\fR >
1), and before termination of the script (if
\f(CW$ENV{PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS}\fR >= 1).  The report format is similar to one
in the following example:
.PP
.Vb 13
\&  env PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS=2 perl -e "require Carp"
\&  Memory allocation statistics after compilation: (buckets 4(4)..8188(8192)
\&     14216 free:   130   117    28     7     9   0   2     2   1 0 0

\&                 74   109   304    84    20
\&  Total sbrk(): 77824/21:119. Odd ends: pad+heads+chain+tail: 0+636+0+2048.
\&  Memory allocation statistics after execution:   (buckets 4(4)..8188(8192)
\&     30888 free:   245    78    85    13     6   2   1     3   2 0 1
\&                315   162    39    42    11
\&    175816 used:   265   176  1112   111    26  22  11    27   2 1 1
\&                196   178  1066   798    39
\&  Total sbrk(): 215040/47:145. Odd ends: pad+heads+chain+tail: 0+2192+0+6144.
.Ve
It is possible to ask for such a statistic at arbitrary moment by
usind \fIDevel::Peek::mstats()\fR (module Devel::Peek is available on \s-1CPAN\s0).
.PP
Here is the explanation of different parts of the format:
.Ip "\f(CWbuckets SMALLEST(APPROX)..GREATEST(APPROX)\fR" 5
Perl's \fImalloc()\fR uses bucketed allocations.  Every request is rounded
up to the closest bucket size available, and a bucket of these size is
taken from the pool of the buckets of this size.
.Sp
The above line describes limits of buckets currently in use.  Each
bucket has two sizes: memory footprint, and the maximal size of user
data which may be put into this bucket.  Say, in the above example the
smallest bucket is both sizes 4.  The biggest bucket has usable size
8188, and the memory footprint 8192.  
.Sp
With debugging Perl some buckets may have negative usable size.  This
means that these buckets cannot (and will not) be used.  For greater
buckets the memory footprint may be one page greater than a power of
2.  In such a case the corresponding power of two is printed instead
in the \f(CWAPPROX\fR field above.
.Ip "Free/Used" 5
The following 1 or 2 rows of numbers correspond to the number of
buckets of each size between \f(CWSMALLEST\fR and \f(CWGREATEST\fR.  In the
first row the sizes (memory footprints) of buckets are powers of two
(or possibly one page greater).  In the second row (if present) the
memory footprints of the buckets are between memory footprints of two
buckets \*(L"above\*(R".  
.Sp
Say, with the above example the memory footprints are (with current
algorith)
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&     free:    8     16    32    64    128  256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192
\&           4     12    24    48    80
.Ve
With non-\f(CWDEBUGGING\fR perl the buckets starting from \f(CW128\fR\-long ones
have 4-byte overhead, thus 8192-long bucket may take up to
8188-byte-long allocations.
.Ip "\f(CWTotal sbrk(): SBRKed/SBRKs:CONTINUOUS\fR" 5
The first two fields give the total amount of memory perl \fIsbrk()\fRed,
and number of \fIsbrk()\fRs used.  The third number is what perl thinks
about continuity of returned chunks.  As far as this number is
positive, \fImalloc()\fR will assume that it is probable that \fIsbrk()\fR will
provide continuous memory.
.Sp
The amounts \fIsbrk()\fRed by external libraries is not counted.
.Ip "\f(CWpad: 0\fR" 5
The amount of \fIsbrk()\fRed memory needed to keep buckets aligned.
.Ip "\f(CWheads: 2192\fR" 5
While memory overhead of bigger buckets is kept inside the bucket, for
smaller buckets it is kept in separate areas.  This field gives the
total size of these areas.
.Ip "\f(CWchain: 0\fR" 5
\fImalloc()\fR may want to subdivide a bigger bucket into smaller buckets.
If only a part of the deceased-bucket is left non-subdivided, the rest
is kept as an element of a linked list.  This field gives the total
size of these chunks.
.Ip "\f(CWtail: 6144\fR" 5
To minimize amount of \fIsbrk()\fRs \fImalloc()\fR asks for more memory.  This
field gives the size of the yet-unused part, which is \fIsbrk()\fRed, but
never touched.

To see this list insert two \f(CWwarn('!...')\fR statements around the call:
.PP

\&  warn('!');
\&  do 'lib/auto/POSIX/autosplit.ix';
\&  warn('!!! "after"');
.Ve
and run it with \fB\-\s-1DL\s0\fR option.  The first \fIwarn()\fR will print memory
allocation info before the parsing of the file, and will memorize the
statistics at this point (we ignore what it prints). The second \fIwarn()\fR
will print increments w.r.t. this memorized statistics.  This is the
above printout.
.PP
Different \fIId\fRs on the left correspond to different subsystems of
perl interpreter, they are just first argument given to perl memory
allocation \s-1API\s0 \fINew()\fR.  To find what \f(CW9 03\fR means \f(CWgrep\fR the perl
source for \f(CW903\fR.  You will see that it is \fIutil.c\fR, function
\fIsavepvn()\fR.  This function is used to store a copy of existing chunk of
memory.  Using C debugger, one can see that it is called either
directly from \fIgv_init()\fR, or via \fIsv_magic()\fR, and \fIgv_init()\fR is called
from \fIgv_fetchpv()\fR \- which is called from \fInewSUB()\fR.
.PP
\fBNote:\fR to reach this place in debugger and skip all the calls to
savepvn during the compilation of the main script, set a C breakpoint
in \fIPerl_warn()\fR, \f(CWcontinue\fR this point is reached, \fIthen\fR set
breakpoint in \fIPerl_savepvn()\fR.  Note that you may need to skip a
handful of \fIPerl_savepvn()\fR which do not correspond to mass production
of CVs (there are more \f(CW903\fR allocations than 146 similar lines of
\fIlib/auto/\s-1POSIX/\s0autosplit.ix\fR).  Note also that \f(CWPerl_\fR prefixes are
added by macroization code in perl header files to avoid conflicts
with external libraries.
.PP
Anyway, we see that \f(CW903\fR ids correspond to creation of globs, twice
per glob \- for glob name, and glob stringification magic.
.PP
Here are explanations for other \fIId\fRs above: 
.Ip "\f(CW717\fR " 5
is for creation of bigger \f(CWXPV*\fR structures.  In the above case it
creates 3 \f(CWAV\fR per subroutine, one for a list of lexical variable
names, one for a scratchpad (which contains lexical variables and
\f(CWtargets\fR), and one for the array of scratchpads needed for
recursion.  
.Sp
It also creates a \f(CWGV\fR and a \f(CWCV\fR per subroutine (all called from
\fIstart_subparse()\fR).
.Ip "\f(CW002\fR" 5
Creates C array corresponding to the \f(CWAV\fR of scratchpads, and the
scratchpad itself (the first fake entry of this scratchpad is created
though the subroutine itself is not defined yet).
.Sp
It also creates C arrays to keep data for the stash (this is one \s-1HV\s0,
but it grows, thus there are 4 big allocations: the big chunks are not
freeed, but are kept as additional arenas for \f(CWSV\fR allocations).
.Ip "\f(CW054\fR" 5
creates a \f(CWHEK\fR for the name of the glob for the subroutine (this
name is a key in a \fIstash\fR).
.Sp
Big allocations with this \fIId\fR correspond to allocations of new
arenas to keep \f(CWHE\fR.
.Ip "\f(CW602\fR" 5
creates a \f(CWGP\fR for the glob for the subroutine.
.Ip "\f(CW702\fR" 5
creates the \f(CWMAGIC\fR for the glob for the subroutine.
.Ip "\f(CW704\fR" 5
creates \fIarenas\fR which keep SVs.
.Sh "\fB\-\s-1DL\s0\fR details"
If Perl is run with \fB\-\s-1DL\s0\fR option, then \fIwarn()\fRs which start with `!\*(R'
behave specially.  They print a list of \fIcategories\fR of memory
allocations, and statistics of allocations of different sizes for
these categories.
.PP
If \fIwarn()\fR string starts with
.Ip "\f(CW!!!\fR " 5
print changed categories only, print the differences in counts of allocations;
.Ip "\f(CW!!\fR " 5
print grown categories only; print the absolute values of counts, and totals;
.Ip "\f(CW!\fR" 5
print nonempty categories, print the absolute values of counts and totals.
.Sh "Limitations of \fB\-\s-1DL\s0\fR statistic"
If an extension or an external library does not use Perl \s-1API\s0 to
allocate memory, these allocations are not counted.
.SH "Debugging regular expressions"
There are two ways to enable debugging output for regular expressions.
.PP
If your perl is compiled with \f(CW-DDEBUGGING\fR, you may use the
\fB\-Dr\fR flag on the command line.
.PP
Otherwise, one can \f(CWuse re 'debug'\fR, which has effects both at
compile time, and at run time (and is \fInot\fR lexically scoped).
.Sh "Compile-time output"
The debugging output for the compile time looks like this:

usually 4-byte words) and the label \fIid\fR of the first node which
does a match.
.PP
The last line (split into two lines in the above) contains the optimizer
info.  In the example shown, the optimizer found that the match 
should contain a substring \f(CWde\fR at the offset 1, and substring \f(CWgh\fR
at some offset between 3 and infinity.  Moreover, when checking for
these substrings (to abandon impossible matches quickly) it will check
for the substring \f(CWgh\fR before checking for the substring \f(CWde\fR.  The
optimizer may also use the knowledge that the match starts (at the
\f(CWfirst\fR \fIid\fR) with a character class, and the match cannot be
shorter than 7 chars.

if the pattern may
match only at a handful of places  (with \f(CWTYPE\fR being
\f(CWBOL\fR, \f(CWMBOL\fR, or \f(CWGPOS\fR, see the table below).
.PP
If a substring is known to match at end-of-line only, it may be
followed by \f(CW$\fR, as in \f(CWfloating `k'$\fR.

found an appropriate place for the match.

.Sh "Run-time output"
First of all, when doing a match, one may get no run-time output even
if debugging is enabled.  this means that the \s-1RE\s0 engine was never
entered, all of the job was done by the optimizer.
.PP
If \s-1RE\s0 engine was entered, the output may look like this:
