.SH "NAME"
Pumpkin \- Notes on handling the Perl Patch Pumpkin And Porting Perl
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
There is no simple synopsis, yet.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document attempts to begin to describe some of the considerations
involved in patching, porting, and maintaining perl.
.PP
This document is still under construction, and still subject to
significant changes.  Still, I hope parts of it will be useful,
so I'm releasing it even though it's not done.
.PP
For the most part, it's a collection of anecdotal information that
already assumes some familiarity with the Perl sources.  I really need
an introductory section that describes the organization of the sources
and all the various auxiliary files that are part of the distribution.
.SH "Where Do I Get Perl Sources and Related Material?"
.IX Header "Where Do I Get Perl Sources and Related Material?"
The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (or \s-1CPAN\s0) is the place to go.
There are many mirrors, but the easiest thing to use is probably
http://www.cpan.org/README.html , which automatically points you to a
mirror site \*(L"close\*(R" to you.
.Sh "Perl5\-porters mailing list"
.IX Subsection "Perl5-porters mailing list"
The mailing list perl5\-porters@perl.org
is the main group working with the development of perl.  If you're
interested in all the latest developments, you should definitely
subscribe.  The list is high volume, but generally has a
fairly low noise level.
.PP
Subscribe by sending the message (in the body of your letter)
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        subscribe perl5-porters
.Ve
.PP
to perl5\-porters\-request@perl.org .
.PP
Archives of the list are held at:

.Ve
.SH "How are Perl Releases Numbered?"
.IX Header "How are Perl Releases Numbered?"
Beginning with v5.6.0, even versions will stand for maintenance releases
and odd versions for development releases, i.e., v5.6.x for maintenance
releases, and v5.7.x for development releases.  Before v5.6.0, subversions
_01 through _49 were reserved for bug-fix maintenance releases, and
subversions _50 through _99 for unstable development versions.
.PP
For example, in v5.6.1, the revision number is 5, the version is 6,
and 1 is the subversion.
.PP
For compatibility with the older numbering scheme the composite floating
point version number continues to be available as the magic variable $],
and amounts to \f(CW\*(C`$revision + $version/1000 + $subversion/100000\*(C'\fR.  This
can still be used in comparisons.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        print "You've got an old perl\en" if $] < 5.005_03;
.Ve
.PP
In addition, the version is also available as a string in $^V.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        print "You've got a new perl\en" if $^V and $^V ge v5.6.0;
.Ve
.PP
You can also require particular version (or later) with:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        use 5.006;
.Ve
.PP
or using the new syntax available only from v5.6 onward:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        use v5.6.0;
.Ve
.PP
At some point in the future, we may need to decide what to call the
next big revision.  In the .package file used by metaconfig to
generate Configure, there are two variables that might be relevant:
\&\f(CW$baserev\fR=5 and \f(CW$package\fR=perl5.
.PP
Perl releases produced by the members of perl5\-porters are usually
available on \s-1CPAN\s0 in the \fIsrc/5.0/maint\fR and \fIsrc/5.0/devel\fR
directories.
.Sh "Maintenance and Development Subversions"
.IX Subsection "Maintenance and Development Subversions"
The first rule of maintenance work is \*(L"First, do no harm.\*(R"
.PP
Trial releases of bug-fix maintenance releases are announced on
perl5\-porters. Trial releases use the new subversion number (to avoid
testers installing it over the previous release) and include a 'local
patch' entry in patchlevel.h. The distribution file contains the
string \f(CW\*(C`MAINT_TRIAL\*(C'\fR to make clear that the file is not meant for
public consumption.
.PP
In general, the names of official distribution files for the public
always match the regular expression:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    ^perl\ed+\e.(\ed+)\e.\ed+(-MAINT_TRIAL_\ed+)\e.tar\e.gz$
.Ve
.PP
\&\f(CW$1\fR in the pattern is always an even number for maintenance
versions, and odd for developer releases.
.PP
In the past it has been observed that pumpkings tend to invent new
naming conventions on the fly. If you are a pumpking, before you
invent a new name for any of the three types of perl distributions,
please inform the guys from the \s-1CPAN\s0 who are doing indexing and
provide the trees of symlinks and the like. They will have to know
\&\fIin advance\fR what you decide.
.Sh "Why is it called the patch pumpkin?"
.IX Subsection "Why is it called the patch pumpkin?"
Chip Salzenberg gets credit for that, with a nod to his cow orker,
David Croy.  We had passed around various names (baton, token, hot
potato) but none caught on.  Then, Chip asked:
.PP
[begin quote]
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   Who has the patch pumpkin?
.Ve
.PP
To explain:  David Croy once told me once that at a previous job,
there was one tape drive and multiple systems that used it for backups.
But instead of some high-tech exclusion software, they used a low-tech
method to prevent multiple simultaneous backups: a stuffed pumpkin.
No one was allowed to make backups unless they had the \*(L"backup pumpkin\*(R".
.PP
[end quote]
.PP
The name has stuck.
.SH "Philosophical Issues in Patching and Porting Perl"
.IX Header "Philosophical Issues in Patching and Porting Perl"
There are no absolute rules, but there are some general guidelines I
have tried to follow as I apply patches to the perl sources.
(This section is still under construction.)
.Sh "Solve problems as generally as possible"
.IX Subsection "Solve problems as generally as possible"
Never implement a specific restricted solution to a problem when you
can solve the same problem in a more general, flexible way.
.PP
For example, for dynamic loading to work on some \s-1SVR4\s0 systems, we had
to build a shared libperl.so library.  In order to build \*(L"\s-1FAT\s0\*(R" binaries
on NeXT 4.0 systems, we had to build a special libperl library.  Rather
than continuing to build a contorted nest of special cases, I
generalized the process of building libperl so that NeXT and \s-1SVR4\s0 users
could still get their work done, but others could build a shared
libperl if they wanted to as well.
.PP
Contain your changes carefully.  Assume nothing about other operating
systems, not even closely related ones.  Your changes must not affect
other platforms.
.PP
Spy shamelessly on how similar patching or porting issues have been
settled elsewhere.
.PP
If feasible, try to keep filenames 8.3\-compliant to humor those poor
souls that get joy from running Perl under such dire limitations.
There's a script, check83.pl, for keeping your nose 8.3\-clean.
In a similar vein, do not create files or directories which differ only
in case (upper versus lower).
.Sh "Seek consensus on major changes"
.IX Subsection "Seek consensus on major changes"
If you are making big changes, don't do it in secret.  Discuss the
ideas in advance on perl5\-porters.
.Sh "Keep the documentation up-to-date"
.IX Subsection "Keep the documentation up-to-date"
If your changes may affect how users use perl, then check to be sure
that the documentation is in sync with your changes.  Be sure to
check all the files \fIpod/*.pod\fR and also the \fI\s-1INSTALL\s0\fR document.
.PP
Consider writing the appropriate documentation first and then
implementing your change to correspond to the documentation.
.Sh "Avoid machine-specific #ifdef's"
.IX Subsection "Avoid machine-specific #ifdef's"
To the extent reasonable, try to avoid machine-specific #ifdef's in
the sources.  Instead, use feature-specific #ifdef's.  The reason is
that the machine-specific #ifdef's may not be valid across major
releases of the operating system.  Further, the feature-specific tests
may help out folks on another platform who have the same problem.
.Sh "Machine-specific files"
.IX Subsection "Machine-specific files"
.IP "source code" 4
.IX Item "source code"
If you have many machine-specific #defines or #includes, consider
creating an \*(L"osish.h\*(R" (os2ish.h, vmsish.h, and so on) and including
that in perl.h.  If you have several machine-specific files (function
emulations, function stubs, build utility wrappers) you may create a
separate subdirectory (djgpp, win32) and put the files in there.
Remember to update \f(CW\*(C`MANIFEST\*(C'\fR when you add files.
.Sp
If your system supports dynamic loading but none of the existing
methods at \fIext/DynaLoader/dl_*.xs\fR work for you, you must write
a new one.  Study the existing ones to see what kind of interface
you must supply.
.IP "build hints" 4
.IX Item "build hints"
There are two kinds of hints: hints for building Perl and hints for
extensions.   The former live in the \f(CW\*(C`hints\*(C'\fR subdirectory, the latter
in \f(CW\*(C`ext/*/hints\*(C'\fR subdirectories.
.Sp
The top level hints are Bourne-shell scripts that set, modify and
unset appropriate Configure variables, based on the Configure command
line options and possibly existing config.sh and Policy.sh files from
previous Configure runs.
.Sp
The extension hints are written in Perl (by the time they are used
miniperl has been built) and control the building of their respective
extensions.  They can be used to for example manipulate compilation
and linking flags.
.IP "build and installation Makefiles, scripts, and so forth" 4
.IX Item "build and installation Makefiles, scripts, and so forth"
Sometimes you will also need to tweak the Perl build and installation
procedure itself, like for example \fIMakefile.SH\fR and \fIinstallperl\fR.
Tread very carefully, even more than usual.  Contain your changes
with utmost care.
.IP "test suite" 4
.IX Item "test suite"
Many of the tests in \f(CW\*(C`t\*(C'\fR subdirectory assume machine-specific things
like existence of certain functions, something about filesystem
semantics, certain external utilities and their error messages.  Use
the \f(CW$^O\fR and the \f(CW\*(C`Config\*(C'\fR module (which contains the results of the
Configure run, in effect the \f(CW\*(C`config.sh\*(C'\fR converted to Perl) to either
skip (preferably not) or customize (preferable) the tests for your
platform.
.IP "modules" 4
.IX Item "modules"
Certain standard modules may need updating if your operating system
sports for example a native filesystem naming.  You may want to update
some or all of the modules File::Basename, File::Spec, File::Path, and
File::Copy to become aware of your native filesystem syntax and
peculiarities.
.Sp
Remember to have a \f(CW$VERSION\fR in the modules.  You can use the
Porting/checkVERSION.pl script for checking this.
.IP "documentation" 4
.IX Item "documentation"
If your operating system comes from outside \s-1UNIX\s0 you almost certainly
will have differences in the available operating system functionality
(missing system calls, different semantics, whatever).  Please
document these at \fIpod/perlport.pod\fR.  If your operating system is
the first \fBnot\fR to have a system call also update the list of
\&\*(L"portability\-bewares\*(R" at the beginning of \fIpod/perlfunc.pod\fR.
.Sp
A file called \fI\s-1README\s0.youros\fR at the top level that explains things
like how to install perl at this platform, where to get any possibly
required additional software, and for example what test suite errors
to expect, is nice too.  Such files are in the process of being written
in pod format and will eventually be renamed \fI\s-1INSTALL\s0.youros\fR.
.Sp
You may also want to write a separate \fI.pod\fR file for your operating
system to tell about existing mailing lists, os-specific modules,
documentation, whatever.  Please name these along the lines of
\&\fIperl\fR\fIyouros\fR.pod.  [unfinished: where to put this file (the pod/
subdirectory, of course: but more importantly, which/what index files
should be updated?)]
.Sh "Allow for lots of testing"
.IX Subsection "Allow for lots of testing"
We should never release a main version without testing it as a
subversion first.
.Sh "Test popular applications and modules."
.IX Subsection "Test popular applications and modules."
We should never release a main version without testing whether or not
it breaks various popular modules and applications.  A partial list of
such things would include majordomo, metaconfig, apache, Tk, \s-1CGI\s0,
libnet, and libwww, to name just a few.  Of course it's quite possible
that some of those things will be just plain broken and need to be fixed,
but, in general, we ought to try to avoid breaking widely-installed
things.
.Sh "Automated generation of derivative files"
.IX Subsection "Automated generation of derivative files"
The \fIembed.h\fR, \fIkeywords.h\fR, \fIopcode.h\fR, and \fIperltoc.pod\fR files
are all automatically generated by perl scripts.  In general, don't
patch these directly; patch the data files instead.
.PP
\&\fIConfigure\fR and \fIconfig_h.SH\fR are also automatically generated by
\&\fBmetaconfig\fR.  In general, you should patch the metaconfig units
instead of patching these files directly.  However, very minor changes
to \fIConfigure\fR may be made in between major sync-ups with the
metaconfig units, which tends to be complicated operations.  But be
careful, this can quickly spiral out of control.  Running metaconfig
is not really hard.
.PP
Also \fIMakefile\fR is automatically produced from \fIMakefile.SH\fR.
In general, look out for all \fI*.SH\fR files.
.PP
Finally, the sample files in the \fIPorting/\fR subdirectory are
generated automatically by the script \fIU/mksample\fR included 
with the metaconfig units.  See \*(L"run metaconfig\*(R" below for
information on obtaining the metaconfig units.
.SH "How to Make a Distribution"
.IX Header "How to Make a Distribution"
There really ought to be a 'make dist' target, but there isn't.
The 'dist' suite of tools also contains a number of tools that I haven't
learned how to use yet.  Some of them may make this all a bit easier.
.PP
Here are the steps I go through to prepare a patch & distribution.
.PP
Lots of it could doubtless be automated but isn't.  The Porting/makerel
(make release) perl script does now help automate some parts of it.
.Sh "Announce your intentions"
.IX Subsection "Announce your intentions"
First, you should volunteer out loud to take the patch pumpkin.  It's
generally counter-productive to have multiple people working in secret
on the same thing.
.PP
At the same time, announce what you plan to do with the patch pumpkin,
to allow folks a chance to object or suggest alternatives, or do it for
you.  Naturally, the patch pumpkin holder ought to incorporate various
bug fixes and documentation improvements that are posted while he or
she has the pumpkin, but there might also be larger issues at stake.
.PP
One of the precepts of the subversion idea is that we shouldn't give
the patch pumpkin to anyone unless we have some idea what he or she
is going to do with it.
.Sh "refresh pod/perltoc.pod"
.IX Subsection "refresh pod/perltoc.pod"
Presumably, you have done a full \f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR in your working source
directory.  Before you \f(CW\*(C`make spotless\*(C'\fR (if you do), and if you have
changed any documentation in any module or pod file, change to the
\&\fIpod\fR directory and run \f(CW\*(C`make toc\*(C'\fR.
.Sh "run installhtml to check the validity of the pod files"
.IX Subsection "run installhtml to check the validity of the pod files"
.Sh "update patchlevel.h"
.IX Subsection "update patchlevel.h"
Don't be shy about using the subversion number, even for a relatively
modest patch.  We've never even come close to using all 99 subversions,
and it's better to have a distinctive number for your patch.  If you
need feedback on your patch, go ahead and issue it and promise to
incorporate that feedback quickly (e.g. within 1 week) and send out a
second patch.
.PP
If you update the subversion number, you may need to change the version
number near the top of the \fIChanges\fR file.
.Sh "run metaconfig"
.IX Subsection "run metaconfig"
If you need to make changes to Configure or config_h.SH, it may be best to
change the appropriate metaconfig units instead, and regenerate Configure.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        metaconfig -m
.Ve
.PP
will regenerate Configure and config_h.SH.  Much more information
on obtaining and running metaconfig is in the \fIU/README\fR file
that comes with Perl's metaconfig units.  Perl's metaconfig units
should be available on \s-1CPAN\s0.  A set of units that will work with
perl5.005 is in the file \fImc_units\-5.005_00\-01.tar.gz\fR under
http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/ANDYD/ .  The mc_units tar file
should be unpacked in your main perl source directory.  Note: those
units were for use with 5.005.  There may have been changes since then.
Check for later versions or contact perl5\-porters@perl.org to obtain a
pointer to the current version.
.PP
Alternatively, do consider if the \fI*ish.h\fR files might be a better
place for your changes.
.Sh "\s-1MANIFEST\s0"
.IX Subsection "MANIFEST"
Make sure the \s-1MANIFEST\s0 is up\-to\-date.  You can use dist's \fBmanicheck\fR
program for this.  You can also use
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    perl -w -MExtUtils::Manifest=fullcheck -e fullcheck
.Ve
.PP
Both commands will also list extra files in the directory that are not
listed in \s-1MANIFEST\s0.
.PP
The \s-1MANIFEST\s0 is normally sorted.
.PP
If you are using metaconfig to regenerate Configure, then you should note
that metaconfig actually uses \s-1MANIFEST\s0.new, so you want to be sure
\&\s-1MANIFEST\s0.new is up-to-date too.  I haven't found the \s-1MANIFEST/MANIFEST\s0.new
distinction particularly useful, but that's probably because I still haven't
learned how to use the full suite of tools in the dist distribution.
.Sh "Check permissions"
.IX Subsection "Check permissions"
All the tests in the t/ directory ought to be executable.  The
main makefile used to do a 'chmod t/*/*.t', but that resulted in
a self-modifying distribution\*(--something some users would strongly
prefer to avoid.  The \fIt/TEST\fR script will check for this
and do the chmod if needed, but the tests still ought to be
executable.
.PP
In all, the following files should probably be executable:
.PP
.Vb 16
\&    Configure
\&    configpm
\&    configure.gnu
\&    embed.pl
\&    installperl
\&    installman
\&    keywords.pl
\&    myconfig
\&    opcode.pl
\&    perly.fixer
\&    t/TEST
\&    t/*/*.t
\&    *.SH
\&    vms/ext/Stdio/test.pl
\&    vms/ext/filespec.t
\&    x2p/*.SH
.Ve
.PP
Other things ought to be readable, at least :\-).
.PP
Probably, the permissions for the files could be encoded in \s-1MANIFEST\s0

.Sh "Update Porting/config.sh and Porting/config_H"
.IX Subsection "Update Porting/config.sh and Porting/config_H"
[\s-1XXX\s0 
This section needs revision.  We're currently working on easing
the task of keeping the vms, win32, and plan9 config.sh info
up\-to\-date.  The plan is to use keep up-to-date 'canned' config.sh
files in the appropriate subdirectories and then generate 'canned'
config.h files for vms, win32, etc. from the generic config.sh file.
This is to ease maintenance.  When Configure gets updated, the parts
sometimes get scrambled around, and the changes in config_H can
sometimes be very hard to follow.  config.sh, on the other hand, can
safely be sorted, so it's easy to track (typically very small) changes
to config.sh and then propoagate them to a canned 'config.h' by any
number of means, including a perl script in win32/ or carrying 
config.sh and config_h.SH to a Unix system and running sh
config_h.SH.)  Vms uses configure.com to generate its own config.sh
and config.h.  If you want to add a new variable to config.sh check
with vms folk how to add it to configure.com too.
\&\s-1XXX\s0]
.PP
The Porting/config.sh and Porting/config_H files are provided to
help those folks who can't run Configure.  It is important to keep
them up\-to\-date.  If you have changed config_h.SH, those changes must
be reflected in config_H as well.  (The name config_H was chosen to
distinguish the file from config.h even on case-insensitive file systems.)
Simply edit the existing config_H file; keep the first few explanatory
lines and then copy your new config.h below.
.PP
It may also be necessary to update win32/config.?c, and
plan9/config.plan9, though you should be quite careful in doing so if
you are not familiar with those systems.  You might want to issue your
patch with a promise to quickly issue a follow-up that handles those
directories.
.Sh "make run_byacc"
.IX Subsection "make run_byacc"
If you have byacc\-1.8.2 (available from \s-1CPAN\s0 as
http://www.cpan.org/src/misc/perl\-byacc1.8.2.tar.gz), and if there have
been changes to \fIperly.y\fR, you can regenerate the \fIperly.c\fR file.  The
run_byacc makefile target does this by running byacc and then applying
some patches so that byacc dynamically allocates space, rather than
having fixed limits.  This patch is handled by the \fIperly.fixer\fR
script.  Depending on the nature of the changes to \fIperly.y\fR, you may
or may not have to hand-edit the patch to apply correctly.  If you do,
you should include the edited patch in the new distribution.  If you
have byacc\-1.9, the patch won't apply cleanly.  Changes to the printf
output statements mean the patch won't apply cleanly.  Long ago I
started to fix \fIperly.fixer\fR to detect this, but I never completed the
task.
.PP
If \f(CW\*(C`perly.c\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`perly.h\*(C'\fR changes, make sure you run \f(CW\*(C`perl vms/vms_yfix.pl\*(C'\fR 
to update the corresponding \s-1VMS\s0 files.  This could be taken care of by 
the regen_all target in the Unix Makefile.  See also 
\&\*(L"VMS\-specific updates\*(R".
.PP
Some additional notes from Larry on this:
.PP
Don't forget to regenerate perly_c.diff.
.PP
.Vb 5

The \fIembed.h\fR, \fIkeywords.h\fR, and \fIopcode.h\fR files are all automatically
generated by perl scripts.  Since the user isn't guaranteed to have a
working perl, we can't require the user to generate them.  Hence you have
to, if you're making a distribution.
.PP
I used to include rules like the following in the makefile:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&    # The following three header files are generated automatically
\&    # The correct versions should be already supplied with the perl kit,
\&    # in case you don't have perl or 'sh' available.

However, I got \fBlots\fR of mail consisting of people worrying because the

.Sh "Binary compatibility"

If you do change \fIglobal.sym\fR or \fIinterp.sym\fR, think carefully about
what you are doing.  To the extent reasonable, we'd like to maintain
source and binary compatibility with older releases of perl.  That way,
extensions built under one version of perl will continue to work with
new versions of perl.
.PP
Of course, some incompatible changes may well be necessary.  I'm just
suggesting that we not make any such changes without thinking carefully
about them first.  If possible, we should provide
backwards-compatibility stubs.  There's a lot of \s-1XS\s0 code out there.
Let's not force people to keep changing it.
.Sh "Changes"
.IX Subsection "Changes"
Be sure to update the \fIChanges\fR file.  Try to include both an overall

audience will include other developers and users, so describe
user-visible changes (if any) in terms they will understand, not in
code like \*(L"initialize foo variable in bar function\*(R".
.PP
There are differing opinions on whether the detailed descriptions
ought to go in the Changes file or whether they ought to be available
separately in the patch file (or both).  There is no disagreement that
detailed descriptions ought to be easily available somewhere.
.PP
If you update the subversion number in \fIpatchlevel.h\fR, you may need
to change the version number near the top of the \fIChanges\fR file.
.Sh "Todo"
.IX Subsection "Todo"
The \fIpod/perltodo.pod\fR file contains a roughly-categorized unordered
list of aspects of Perl that could use enhancement, features that could
be added, areas that could be cleaned up, and so on.  During your term
as pumpkin\-holder, you will probably address some of these issues, and
perhaps identify others which, while you decide not to address them this
time around, may be tackled in the future.  Update the file to reflect
the situation as it stands when you hand over the pumpkin.
.PP
You might like, early in your pumpkin-holding career, to see if you
can find champions for partiticular issues on the to-do list: an issue
owned is an issue more likely to be resolved.

There are also some more porting-specific \*(L"Todo\*(R" items later in this

.Sh "OS/2\-specific updates"
.IX Subsection "OS/2-specific updates"
In the os2 directory is \fIdiff.configure\fR, a set of OS/2\-specific
diffs against \fBConfigure\fR.  If you make changes to Configure, you may
want to consider regenerating this diff file to save trouble for the
\&\s-1OS/2\s0 maintainer.
.PP
You can also consider the \s-1OS/2\s0 diffs as reminders of portability
things that need to be fixed in Configure.
.Sh "VMS-specific updates"
.IX Subsection "VMS-specific updates"
If you have changed \fIperly.y\fR or \fIperly.c\fR, then you most probably want
to update \fIvms/perly_{h,c}.vms\fR by running \f(CW\*(C`perl vms/vms_yfix.pl\*(C'\fR, or
by running `make regen_all` which will run that script for you.

It is courteous to update that if necessary.
.Sh "Making the new distribution"
.IX Subsection "Making the new distribution"
Suppose, for example, that you want to make version 5.004_08.  Then you can
do something like the following
.PP

\&        mkdir ../perl5.004_08
\&        awk '{print $1}' MANIFEST | cpio -pdm ../perl5.004_08

I find the \fImakepatch\fR utility quite handy for making patches.
You can obtain it from any \s-1CPAN\s0 archive under
http://www.cpan.org/authors/Johan_Vromans/ .  There are a couple
of differences between my version and the standard one. I have mine do
a
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        # Print a reassuring "End of Patch" note so people won't
\&        # wonder if their mailer truncated patches.
\&        print "\en\enEnd of Patch.\en";
.Ve
.PP
at the end.  That's because I used to get questions from people asking
if their mail was truncated.
.PP
It also writes Index: lines which include the new directory prefix
(change Index: print, approx line 294 or 310 depending on the version,
to read:  print \s-1PATCH\s0 (\*(L"Index: \f(CW$newdir\fR$new\en\*(R");).  That helps patches
work with more \s-1POSIX\s0 conformant patch programs.
.PP
Here's how I generate a new patch.  I'll use the hypothetical
5.004_07 to 5.004_08 patch as an example.
.PP
.Vb 5
\&        # unpack perl5.004_07/
\&        gzip -d -c perl5.004_07.tar.gz | tar -xof -
\&        # unpack perl5.004_08/
\&        gzip -d -c perl5.004_08.tar.gz | tar -xof -
\&        makepatch perl5.004_07 perl5.004_08 > perl5.004_08.pat
.Ve
.PP
Makepatch will automatically generate appropriate \fBrm\fR commands to remove
deleted files.  Unfortunately, it will not correctly set permissions
for newly created files, so you may have to do so manually.  For example,
patch 5.003_04 created a new test \fIt/op/gv.t\fR which needs to be executable,
so at the top of the patch, I inserted the following lines:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        # Make a new test
\&        touch t/op/gv.t
\&        chmod +x t/opt/gv.t
.Ve
.PP
Now, of course, my patch is now wrong because makepatch didn't know I
was going to do that command, and it patched against /dev/null.
.PP
So, what I do is sort out all such shell commands that need to be in the
patch (including possible mv-ing of files, if needed) and put that in the
shell commands at the top of the patch.  Next, I delete all the patch parts
of perl5.004_08.pat, leaving just the shell commands.  Then, I do the
following:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&        cd perl5.004_07
\&        sh ../perl5.004_08.pat
\&        cd ..
\&        makepatch perl5.004_07 perl5.004_08 >> perl5.004_08.pat
.Ve
.PP
(Note the append to preserve my shell commands.)
Now, my patch will line up with what the end users are going to do.

do so (like Linux, see cflags.SH for the full list), and on some
platforms only one (Solaris can do only \-pedantic, not \-ansi).
The flag \-DPERL_GCC_PEDANTIC also gets added, since gcc does not add
any internal cpp flag to signify that \-pedantic is being used, as it
does for \-ansi (_\|_STRICT_ANSI_\|_).

Note that the \-ansi and \-pedantic are enabled only for version 3 (and

.SH "Running Purify"

Purify is a commercial tool that is helpful in identifying memory
overruns, wild pointers, memory leaks and other such badness.  Perl
must be compiled in a specific way for optimal testing with Purify.
.PP
Use the following commands to test perl with Purify:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&        sh Configure -des -Doptimize=-g -Uusemymalloc -Dusemultiplicity \e
\&            -Accflags=-DPURIFY

\&        ln -s ../pureperl perl
\&        setenv PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL 2
\&        ./perl TEST
.Ve
.PP
Disabling Perl's malloc allows Purify to monitor allocations and leaks
more closely; using Perl's malloc will make Purify report most leaks
in the \*(L"potential\*(R" leaks category.  Enabling the multiplicity option
allows perl to clean up thoroughly when the interpreter shuts down, which
reduces the number of bogus leak reports from Purify.  The \-DPURIFY
enables any Purify-specific debugging code in the sources.
.PP
Purify outputs messages in \*(L"Viewer\*(R" windows by default.  If you don't have
a windowing environment or if you simply want the Purify output to
unobtrusively go to a log file instead of to the interactive window,
use the following options instead:
.PP
.Vb 2

The only currently known leaks happen when there are compile-time errors
within eval or require.  (Fixing these is non\-trivial, unfortunately, but
they must be fixed eventually.)

.IP "Probably Prefer \s-1POSIX\s0" 4

It's often the case that you'll need to choose whether to do
something the BSD-ish way or the POSIX-ish way.  It's usually not
a big problem when the two systems use different names for similar
functions, such as \fImemcmp()\fR and \fIbcmp()\fR.  The perl.h header file
handles these by appropriate #defines, selecting the \s-1POSIX\s0 mem*()
functions if available, but falling back on the b*() functions, if
need be.
.Sp
More serious is the case where some brilliant person decided to
use the same function name but give it a different meaning or
calling sequence :\-).  \fIgetpgrp()\fR and \fIsetpgrp()\fR come to mind.
These are a real problem on systems that aim for conformance to
one standard (e.g. \s-1POSIX\s0), but still try to support the other way
of doing things (e.g. \s-1BSD\s0).  My general advice (still not really
implemented in the source) is to do something like the following.
Suppose there are two alternative versions, \fIfooPOSIX()\fR and

Nice idea, right?
.Sp
Unfortunately, some systems apparently have a prototype for \fIpause()\fR
in \fIunistd.h\fR, but don't actually have the function in the library.
(Or maybe they do have it in a library we're not using.)
.Sp
Thus, the compiler sees something like
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    extern int pause(void);
\&    /* . . . */
\&    #define pause() sleep((32767<<16)+32767)
.Ve
.Sp
and dies with an error message.  (Some compilers don't mind this;
others apparently do.)
.Sp
To work around this, 5.003_03 and later have the following in perl.h:
.Sp
.Vb 9
\&    /* Some unistd.h's give a prototype for pause() even though
\&       HAS_PAUSE ends up undefined.  This causes the #define
\&       below to be rejected by the compiler.  Sigh.
\&    */
\&    #ifdef HAS_PAUSE
\&    #  define Pause     pause
\&    #else
\&    #  define Pause() sleep((32767<<16)+32767)
\&    #endif
.Ve
.Sp
This works.
.Sp
The curious reader may wonder why I didn't do the following in
\&\fIutil.c\fR instead:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&    #ifndef HAS_PAUSE
\&    void pause()
\&    {
\&    sleep((32767<<16)+32767);
\&    }
\&    #endif
.Ve
.Sp
That is, since the function is missing, just provide it.
Then things would probably be been alright, it would seem.
.Sp
Well, almost.  It could be made to work.  The problem arises from the
conflicting needs of dynamic loading and namespace protection.
.Sp
For dynamic loading to work on \s-1AIX\s0 (and \s-1VMS\s0) we need to provide a list
of symbols to be exported.  This is done by the script \fIperl_exp.SH\fR,
which reads \fIglobal.sym\fR and \fIinterp.sym\fR.  Thus, the \f(CW\*(C`pause\*(C'\fR
symbol would have to be added to \fIglobal.sym\fR  So far, so good.
.Sp
On the other hand, one of the goals of Perl5 is to make it easy to
either extend or embed perl and link it with other libraries.  This
means we have to be careful to keep the visible namespace \*(L"clean\*(R".
That is, we don't want perl's global variables to conflict with
those in the other application library.  Although this work is still
in progress, the way it is currently done is via the \fIembed.h\fR file.
This file is built from the \fIglobal.sym\fR and \fIinterp.sym\fR files,
since those files already list the globally visible symbols.  If we
had added \f(CW\*(C`pause\*(C'\fR to global.sym, then \fIembed.h\fR would contain the
line
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    #define pause       Perl_pause
.Ve
.Sp
and calls to \f(CW\*(C`pause\*(C'\fR in the perl sources would now point to
\&\f(CW\*(C`Perl_pause\*(C'\fR.  Now, when \fBld\fR is run to build the \fIperl\fR executable,
it will go looking for \f(CW\*(C`perl_pause\*(C'\fR, which probably won't exist in any
of the standard libraries.  Thus the build of perl will fail.
.Sp
Those systems where \f(CW\*(C`HAS_PAUSE\*(C'\fR is not defined would be ok, however,
since they would get a \f(CW\*(C`Perl_pause\*(C'\fR function in util.c.  The rest of
the world would be in trouble.
.Sp
And yes, this scenario has happened.  On \s-1SCO\s0, the function \f(CW\*(C`chsize\*(C'\fR
is available.  (I think it's in \fI\-lx\fR, the Xenix compatibility
library.)  Since the perl4 days (and possibly before), Perl has
included a \f(CW\*(C`chsize\*(C'\fR function that gets called something akin to
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    #ifndef HAS_CHSIZE
\&    I32 chsize(fd, length)
\&    /*  . . . */
\&    #endif
.Ve
.Sp
When 5.003 added
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    #define chsize      Perl_chsize
.Ve
.Sp
to \fIembed.h\fR, the compile started failing on \s-1SCO\s0 systems.
.Sp
The \*(L"fix\*(R" is to give the function a different name.  The one
implemented in 5.003_05 isn't optimal, but here's what was done:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&    #ifdef HAS_CHSIZE
\&    # ifdef my_chsize  /* Probably #defined to Perl_my_chsize in embed.h */
\&    #   undef my_chsize
\&    # endif
\&    # define my_chsize chsize
\&    #endif
.Ve
.Sp
My explanatory comment in patch 5.003_05 said:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&     Undef and then re-define my_chsize from Perl_my_chsize to
\&     just plain chsize if this system HAS_CHSIZE.  This probably only
\&     applies to SCO.  This shows the perils of having internal
\&     functions with the same name as external library functions :-).
.Ve
.Sp
Now, we can safely put \f(CW\*(C`my_chsize\*(C'\fR in \fIglobal.sym\fR, export it, and
hide it with \fIembed.h\fR.
.Sp
To be consistent with what I did for \f(CW\*(C`pause\*(C'\fR, I probably should have
called the new function \f(CW\*(C`Chsize\*(C'\fR, rather than \f(CW\*(C`my_chsize\*(C'\fR.
However, the perl sources are quite inconsistent on this (Consider
New, Mymalloc, and Myremalloc, to name just a few.)
.Sp
There is a problem with this fix, however, in that \f(CW\*(C`Perl_chsize\*(C'\fR
was available as a \fIlibperl.a\fR library function in 5.003, but it
isn't available any more (as of 5.003_07).  This means that we've
broken binary compatibility.  This is not good.
.IP "Providing missing functions \*(-- some ideas" 4
.IX Item "Providing missing functions  some ideas"
We currently don't have a standard way of handling such missing
function names.  Right now, I'm effectively thinking aloud about a
solution.  Some day, I'll try to formally propose a solution.
.Sp
Part of the problem is that we want to have some functions listed as
exported but not have their names mangled by embed.h or possibly
conflict with names in standard system headers.  We actually already
have such a list at the end of \fIperl_exp.SH\fR (though that list is
out\-of\-date):
.Sp
.Vb 24
\&    # extra globals not included above.
\&    cat <<END >> perl.exp
\&    perl_init_ext
\&    perl_init_fold
\&    perl_init_i18nl14n
\&    perl_alloc
\&    perl_construct
\&    perl_destruct
\&    perl_free
\&    perl_parse
\&    perl_run
\&    perl_get_sv
\&    perl_get_av
\&    perl_get_hv
\&    perl_get_cv
\&    perl_call_argv
\&    perl_call_pv
\&    perl_call_method
\&    perl_call_sv
\&    perl_requirepv
\&    safecalloc
\&    safemalloc
\&    saferealloc
\&    safefree
.Ve
.Sp
This still needs much thought, but I'm inclined to think that one
possible solution is to prefix all such functions with \f(CW\*(C`perl_\*(C'\fR in the
source and list them along with the other \f(CW\*(C`perl_*\*(C'\fR functions in
\&\fIperl_exp.SH\fR.
.Sp
Thus, for \f(CW\*(C`chsize\*(C'\fR, we'd do something like the following:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    /* in perl.h */
\&    #ifdef HAS_CHSIZE
\&    #  define perl_chsize chsize
\&    #endif
.Ve
.Sp
then in some file (e.g. \fIutil.c\fR or \fIdoio.c\fR) do
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    #ifndef HAS_CHSIZE
\&    I32 perl_chsize(fd, length)
\&    /* implement the function here . . . */
\&    #endif
.Ve
.Sp
Alternatively, we could just always use \f(CW\*(C`chsize\*(C'\fR everywhere and move
\&\f(CW\*(C`chsize\*(C'\fR from \fIglobal.sym\fR to the end of \fIperl_exp.SH\fR.  That would
probably be fine as long as our \f(CW\*(C`chsize\*(C'\fR function agreed with all the
\&\f(CW\*(C`chsize\*(C'\fR function prototypes in the various systems we'll be using.
As long as the prototypes in actual use don't vary that much, this is
probably a good alternative.  (As a counter\-example, note how Configure
and perl have to go through hoops to find and use get Malloc_t and
Free_t for \f(CW\*(C`malloc\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`free\*(C'\fR.)
.Sp
At the moment, this latter option is what I tend to prefer.

.SH "Miscellaneous Topics"
.IX Header "Miscellaneous Topics"
.Sh "Autoconf"
.IX Subsection "Autoconf"
Why does perl use a metaconfig-generated Configure script instead of an
autoconf-generated configure script?
.PP
Metaconfig and autoconf are two tools with very similar purposes.
Metaconfig is actually the older of the two, and was originally written
by Larry Wall, while autoconf is probably now used in a wider variety of
packages.  The autoconf info file discusses the history of autoconf and
how it came to be.  The curious reader is referred there for further
information.
.PP
Overall, both tools are quite good, I think, and the choice of which one
to use could be argued either way.  In March, 1994, when I was just
starting to work on Configure support for Perl5, I considered both
autoconf and metaconfig, and eventually decided to use metaconfig for the
following reasons:
.IP "Compatibility with Perl4" 4
.IX Item "Compatibility with Perl4"
Perl4 used metaconfig, so many of the #ifdef's were already set up for
metaconfig.  Of course metaconfig had evolved some since Perl4's days,
but not so much that it posed any serious problems.
.IP "Metaconfig worked for me" 4
.IX Item "Metaconfig worked for me"
My system at the time was Interactive 2.2, an \s-1SVR3\s0.2/386 derivative that
also had some \s-1POSIX\s0 support.  Metaconfig-generated Configure scripts
worked fine for me on that system.  On the other hand, autoconf-generated
scripts usually didn't.  (They did come quite close, though, in some
cases.)  At the time, I actually fetched a large number of \s-1GNU\s0 packages
and checked.  Not a single one configured and compiled correctly
out-of-the-box with the system's cc compiler.
.IP "Configure can be interactive" 4
.IX Item "Configure can be interactive"
With both autoconf and metaconfig, if the script works, everything is
fine.  However, one of my main problems with autoconf-generated scripts
was that if it guessed wrong about something, it could be \fBvery\fR hard to
go back and fix it.  For example, autoconf always insisted on passing the
\&\-Xp flag to cc (to turn on \s-1POSIX\s0 behavior), even when that wasn't what I
wanted or needed for that package.  There was no way short of editing the
configure script to turn this off.  You couldn't just edit the resulting
Makefile at the end because the \-Xp flag influenced a number of other
configure tests.
.Sp
Metaconfig's Configure scripts, on the other hand, can be interactive.
Thus if Configure is guessing things incorrectly, you can go back and fix
them.  This isn't as important now as it was when we were actively
developing Configure support for new features such as dynamic loading,
but it's still useful occasionally.
.IP "\s-1GPL\s0" 4
.IX Item "GPL"
At the time, autoconf-generated scripts were covered under the \s-1GNU\s0 Public
License, and hence weren't suitable for inclusion with Perl, which has a
different licensing policy.  (Autoconf's licensing has since changed.)
.IP "Modularity" 4
.IX Item "Modularity"
Metaconfig builds up Configure from a collection of discrete pieces
called \*(L"units\*(R".  You can override the standard behavior by supplying your
own unit.  With autoconf, you have to patch the standard files instead.
I find the metaconfig \*(L"unit\*(R" method easier to work with.  Others
may find metaconfig's units clumsy to work with.
.Sh "Why isn't there a directory to override Perl's library?"
.IX Subsection "Why isn't there a directory to override Perl's library?"
Mainly because no one's gotten around to making one.  Note that
\&\*(L"making one\*(R"  involves changing perl.c, Configure, config_h.SH (and
associated files, see above), and \fIdocumenting\fR it all in the
\&\s-1INSTALL\s0 file.
.PP
Apparently, most folks who want to override one of the standard library
files simply do it by overwriting the standard library files.
.Sh "\s-1APPLLIB\s0"
.IX Subsection "APPLLIB"
In the perl.c sources, you'll find an undocumented \s-1APPLLIB_EXP\s0
variable, sort of like \s-1PRIVLIB_EXP\s0 and \s-1ARCHLIB_EXP\s0 (which are
documented in config_h.SH).  Here's what \s-1APPLLIB_EXP\s0 is for, from
a mail message from Larry:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    The main intent of APPLLIB_EXP is for folks who want to send out a
\&    version of Perl embedded in their product.  They would set the symbol
\&    to be the name of the library containing the files needed to run or to
\&    support their particular application.  This works at the "override"
\&    level to make sure they get their own versions of any library code that
\&    they absolutely must have configuration control over.
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    As such, I don't see any conflict with a sysadmin using it for a
\&    override-ish sort of thing, when installing a generic Perl.  It should
\&    probably have been named something to do with overriding though.  Since
\&    it's undocumented we could still change it...  :-)
.Ve
.PP
Given that it's already there, you can use it to override distribution modules.
One way to do that is to add
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ccflags="$ccflags -DAPPLLIB_EXP=\e"/my/override\e""
.Ve
.PP
to your config.over file.  (You have to be particularly careful to get the
double quotes in.  \s-1APPLLIB_EXP\s0 must be a valid C string.  It might
actually be easier to just #define it yourself in perl.c.)
.PP
Then perl.c will put /my/override ahead of \s-1ARCHLIB\s0 and \s-1PRIVLIB\s0.  Perl will
also search architecture-specific and version-specific subdirectories of
\&\s-1APPLLIB_EXP\s0.
.Sh "Shared libperl.so location"
.IX Subsection "Shared libperl.so location"
Why isn't the shared libperl.so installed in /usr/lib/ along
with \*(L"all the other\*(R" shared libraries?  Instead, it is installed
in \f(CW$archlib\fR, which is typically something like
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        /usr/local/lib/perl5/archname/5.00404
.Ve
.PP
and is architecture\- and version\-specific.
.PP
The basic reason why a shared libperl.so gets put in \f(CW$archlib\fR is so that
you can have more than one version of perl on the system at the same time,
and have each refer to its own libperl.so.
.PP
Three examples might help.  All of these work now; none would work if you
put libperl.so in /usr/lib.
.IP "1." 4
Suppose you want to have both threaded and non-threaded perl versions
around.  Configure will name both perl libraries \*(L"libperl.so\*(R" (so that
you can link to them with \-lperl).  The perl binaries tell them apart
by having looking in the appropriate \f(CW$archlib\fR directories.
.IP "2." 4
Suppose you have perl5.004_04 installed and you want to try to compile
it again, perhaps with different options or after applying a patch.
If you already have libperl.so installed in /usr/lib/, then it may be
either difficult or impossible to get ld.so to find the new libperl.so
that you're trying to build.  If, instead, libperl.so is tucked away in
\&\f(CW$archlib\fR, then you can always just change \f(CW$archlib\fR in the current perl
you're trying to build so that ld.so won't find your old libperl.so.
(The \s-1INSTALL\s0 file suggests you do this when building a debugging perl.)
.IP "3." 4
The shared perl library is not a \*(L"well\-behaved\*(R" shared library with
proper major and minor version numbers, so you can't necessarily
have perl5.004_04 and perl5.004_05 installed simultaneously.  Suppose
perl5.004_04 were to install /usr/lib/libperl.so.4.4, and perl5.004_05
were to install /usr/lib/libperl.so.4.5.  Now, when you try to run
perl5.004_04, ld.so might try to load libperl.so.4.5, since it has
the right \*(L"major version\*(R" number.  If this works at all, it almost
certainly defeats the reason for keeping perl5.004_04 around.  Worse,
with development subversions, you certaily can't guarantee that
libperl.so.4.4 and libperl.so.4.55 will be compatible.
.Sp
Anyway, all this leads to quite obscure failures that are sure to drive
casual users crazy.  Even experienced users will get confused :\-).  Upon
reflection, I'd say leave libperl.so in \f(CW$archlib\fR.
.Sh "Indentation style"

.Ve
.PP
A more ambitious solution would also specify a list of Perl specific
types with \-TSV \-TAV \-THV .. \-TMAGIC \-TPerlIO ... but that list would
be quite ungainly.  Also note that \s-1GNU\s0 indent also doesn't do aligning
of consecutive assignments, which would truly wreck the layout in
places like sv.\fIc:Perl_sv_upgrade()\fR or sv.\fIc:Perl_clone_using()\fR.

The perl Configure script automatically determines which headers and
functions you have available on your system and arranges for them to be
included in the compilation and linking process.  Occasionally, when porting
perl to an operating system for the first time, you may find that the
operating system is missing a key function.  While perl may still build
without this function, no perl program will be able to reference the missing
function.  You may be able to write the missing function yourself, or you
may be able to find the missing function in the distribution files for
another software package.  In this case, you need to instruct the perl
configure-and-build process to use your function.  Perform these steps.

the perl source code).  The final line (\*(L"test \-h...\*(R") adds a symbolic link
to the top-level directory so that make can find vos.c.  Of course, you
should use your own operating system name for the source file of extensions,
not \*(L"vos.c\*(R".

Currently, we just give up.

.IX Item "bypassing safe*alloc wrappers"
On some systems, it may be safe to call the system malloc directly
without going through the util.c safe* layers.  (Such systems would
accept \fIfree\fR\|(0), for example.)  This might be a time-saver for systems
that already have a good malloc.  (Recent Linux libc's apparently have
a nice malloc that is well-tuned for the system.)

Get some of the Macintosh stuff folded back into the main distribution.

.IX Item "gconvert replacement"
Maybe include a replacement function that doesn't lose data in rare
cases of coercion between string and numerical values.
.IP "Improve makedepend" 4
.IX Item "Improve makedepend"
The current makedepend process is clunky and annoyingly slow, but it
works for most folks.  Alas, it assumes that there is a filename
\&\f(CW$firstmakefile\fR that the \fBmake\fR command will try to use before it uses
\&\fIMakefile\fR.  Such may not be the case for all \fBmake\fR commands,
particularly those on non-Unix systems.
.Sp
Probably some variant of the \s-1BSD\s0 \fI.depend\fR file will be useful.
We ought to check how other packages do this, if they do it at all.
We could probably pre-generate the dependencies (with the exception of
malloc.o, which could probably be determined at \fIMakefile.SH\fR
extraction time.
.IP "\s-1GNU\s0 Makefile standard targets" 4
.IX Item "GNU Makefile standard targets"
\&\s-1GNU\s0 software generally has standardized Makefile targets.  Unless we
have good reason to do otherwise, I see no reason not to support them.
.IP "File locking" 4
.IX Item "File locking"
Somehow, straighten out, document, and implement \fIlockf()\fR, \fIflock()\fR,
and/or \fIfcntl()\fR file locking.  It's a mess.  See \f(CW$d_fcntl_can_lock\fR
in recent config.sh files though.
.Sh "Copyright Issues"
.IX Subsection "Copyright Issues"
The following is based on the consensus of a couple of \s-1IPR\s0 lawyers,
but it is of course not a legally binding statement, just a common
sense summary.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Tacking on copyright statements is unnecessary to begin with because
of the Berne convention.  But assuming you want to go ahead...
.IP "\(bu" 4
The right form of a copyright statement is
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        Copyright (C) Year, Year, ... by Someone
.Ve
.Sp
The (C) is not required everywhere but it doesn't hurt and in certain
jurisdictions it is required, so let's leave it in.  (Yes, it's true
that in some jurisdictions the \*(L"(C)\*(R" is not legally binding, one should
use the true ringed\-C.  But we don't have that character available for
Perl's source code.)
.Sp
The years must be listed out separately.  Year-Year is not correct.
Only the years when the piece has changed 'significantly' may be added.
.IP "\(bu" 4
One cannot give away one's copyright trivially.  One can give one's
copyright away by using public domain, but even that requires a little
bit more than just saying 'this is in public domain'.  (What it
exactly requires depends on your jurisdiction.)  But barring public
domain, one cannot \*(L"transfer\*(R" one's copyright to another person or
entity.  In the context of software, it means that contributors cannot
give away their copyright or \*(L"transfer\*(R" it to the \*(L"owner\*(R" of the software.
.Sp
Also remember that in many cases if you are employed by someone,
your work may be copyrighted to your employer, even when you are
contributing on your own time (this all depends on too many things
to list here).  But the bottom line is that you definitely can't give
away a copyright you may not even have.
.Sp
What is possible, however, is that the software can simply state
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        Copyright (C) Year, Year, ... by Someone and others
.Ve
.Sp
and then list the \*(L"others\*(R" somewhere in the distribution.
And this is exactly what Perl does.  (The \*(L"somewhere\*(R" is
\&\s-1AUTHORS\s0 and the Changes* files.)
.IP "\(bu" 4
Split files, merged files, and generated files are problematic.
The rule of thumb: in split files, copy the copyright years of
the original file to all the new files; in merged files make
an union of the copyright years of all the old files; in generated
files propagate the copyright years of the generating file(s).
.IP "\(bu" 4
The files of Perl source code distribution do carry a lot of
copyrights, by various people.  (There are many copyrights embedded in
perl.c, for example.)  The most straightforward thing for pumpkings to
do is to simply update Larry's copyrights at the beginning of the
*.[hcy], x2p/*.[hcy], *.pl, and \s-1README\s0 files, and leave all other
copyrights alone.  Doing more than that requires quite a bit of tracking.
