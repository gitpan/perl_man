.SH "NAME"
perlos2 \- Perl under OS/2, DOS, Win0.3*, Win0.95 and WinNT.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
One can read this document in the following formats:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&        man perlos2
\&        view perl perlos2
\&        explorer perlos2.html
\&        info perlos2
.Ve
to list some (not all may be available simultaneously), or it may
be read \fIas is\fR: either as \fIREADME.os2\fR, or \fIpod/perlos2.pod\fR.
.PP
To read the \fI.INF\fR version of documentation (\fBvery\fR recommended)
outside of OS/2, one needs an IBM's reader (may be available on IBM
ftp sites (?)  (URL anyone?)) or shipped with PC DOS 7.0 and IBM's
Visual Age \*(C+ 3.5.
.PP
A copy of a Win* viewer is contained in the \*(L"Just add OS/2 Warp\*(R" package
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/ps/products/os2/tools/jaow/jaow.zip
.Ve
in \fI?:\eJUST_ADD\eview.exe\fR. This gives one an access to EMX's 
\&\fI.INF\fR docs as well (text form is available in \fI/emx/doc\fR in 
EMX's distribution).
.PP
Note that if you have \fIlynx.exe\fR installed, you can follow WWW links
from this document in \fI.INF\fR format. If you have EMX docs installed 
correctly, you can follow library links (you need to have \f(CWview emxbook\fR
working by setting \f(CWEMXBOOK\fR environment variable as it is described
in EMX docs).
.Sh "Target"
The target is to make \s-1OS/2\s0 the best supported platform for
using/building/developing Perl and \fIPerl applications\fR, as well as
make Perl the best language to use under \s-1OS/2\s0. The secondary target is
to try to make this work under \s-1DOS\s0 and Win* as well (but not \fBtoo\fR hard).
.PP
The current state is quite close to this target. Known limitations:
.Ip "\(bu" 5
Some *nix programs use \fIfork()\fR a lot, but currently \fIfork()\fR is not
supported after \fIuse\fRing dynamically loaded extensions.
.Ip "\(bu" 5
You need a separate perl executable \fIperl_\|_.exe\fR (see the \fIperl_\|_.exe\fR manpage)
to use \s-1PM\s0 code in your application (like the forthcoming Perl/Tk).
.Ip "\(bu" 5
There is no simple way to access \s-1WPS\s0 objects. The only way I know
is via \f(CWOS2::REXX\fR extension (see the \fI\s-1OS2::REXX\s0\fR manpage), and we do not have access to
convenience methods of Object-\s-1REXX\s0. (Is it possible at all? I know
of no Object-\s-1REXX\s0 \s-1API\s0.)
.PP
Please keep this list up-to-date by informing me about other items.
.Sh "Other OSes"
Since \s-1OS/2\s0 port of perl uses a remarkable \s-1EMX\s0 environment, it can
run (and build extensions, and \- possibly \- be build itself) under any
environment which can run \s-1EMX\s0. The current list is \s-1DOS\s0,
\s-1DOS\s0\-inside-\s-1OS/2\s0, Win0.3*, Win0.95 and WinNT. Out of many perl flavors,
only one works, see the section on \fIperl_.exe\fR.
.PP
Note that not all features of Perl are available under these
environments. This depends on the features the \fIextender\fR \- most
probably \s-1RSX\s0 \- decided to implement.
.PP
Cf. the \fIPrerequisites\fR manpage.
.Sh "Prerequisites"
.Ip "\s-1EMX\s0" 6
\s-1EMX\s0 runtime is required (may be substituted by \s-1RSX\s0). Note that
it is possible to make \fIperl_.exe\fR to run under \s-1DOS\s0 without any
external support by binding \fIemx.exe\fR/\fIrsx.exe\fR to it, see the \fIemxbind\fR manpage. Note
that under \s-1DOS\s0 for best results one should use \s-1RSX\s0 runtime, which
has much more functions working (like \f(CWfork\fR, \f(CWpopen\fR and so on). In
fact \s-1RSX\s0 is required if there is no \s-1VCPI\s0 present. Note the
\s-1RSX\s0 requires \s-1DPMI\s0.
.Sp
Only the latest runtime is supported, currently \f(CW0.9c\fR. Perl may run
under earlier versions of \s-1EMX\s0, but this is not tested.
.Sp
One can get different parts of \s-1EMX\s0 from, say
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/os2/emx09c/
\&  ftp://hobbes.nmsu.edu/os2/unix/emx09c/
.Ve
The runtime component should have the name \fIemxrt.zip\fR.
.Sp
\fB\s-1NOTE\s0\fR. It is enough to have \fIemx.exe\fR/\fIrsx.exe\fR on your path. One
does not need to specify them explicitly (though this
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  emx perl_.exe -de 0
.Ve
will work as well.)
.Ip "\s-1RSX\s0" 6
To run Perl on \s-1DPMI\s0 platforms one needs \s-1RSX\s0 runtime. This is
needed under \s-1DOS\s0\-inside-\s-1OS/2\s0, Win0.3*, Win0.95 and WinNT (see 
the section on \fIOther OSes\fR). \s-1RSX\s0 would not work with \s-1VCPI\s0
only, as \s-1EMX\s0 would, it requires \s-1DMPI\s0.
.Sp
Having \s-1RSX\s0 and the latest \fIsh.exe\fR one gets a fully functional
\fB*nix\fR\-ish environment under \s-1DOS\s0, say, \f(CWfork\fR, \f(CW``\fR and
pipe-\f(CWopen\fR work. In fact, MakeMaker works (for static build), so one
can have Perl development environment under \s-1DOS\s0. 
.Sp
One can get \s-1RSX\s0 from, say
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/os2/emx09c/contrib
\&  ftp://ftp.uni-bielefeld.de/pub/systems/msdos/misc
\&  ftp://ftp.leo.org/pub/comp/os/os2/leo/devtools/emx+gcc/contrib
.Ve
Contact the author on \f(CWrainer@mathematik.uni-bielefeld.de\fR.
.Sp
The latest \fIsh.exe\fR with \s-1DOS\s0 hooks is available at
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  ftp://ftp.math.ohio-state.edu/pub/users/ilya/os2/sh_dos.zip
.Ve
.Ip "\s-1HPFS\s0" 6
Perl does not care about file systems, but to install the whole perl
library intact one needs a file system which supports long file names.
.Sp
Note that if you do not plan to build the perl itself, it may be
possible to fool \s-1EMX\s0 to truncate file names. This is not supported,
read \s-1EMX\s0 docs to see how to do it.
.Ip "pdksh" 6
To start external programs with complicated command lines (like with
pipes in between, and/or quoting of arguments), Perl uses an external
shell. With \s-1EMX\s0 port such shell should be named <sh.exe>, and located
either in the wired-in-during-compile locations (usually \fIF:/bin\fR),
or in configurable location (see the section on \fI\s-1PERL_SH_DIR\s0\fR).
.Sp
For best results use \s-1EMX\s0 pdksh. The soon-to-be-available standard
binary (5.2.12?) runs under \s-1DOS\s0 (with the \fI\s-1RSX\s0\fR manpage) as well, meanwhile use
the binary from
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  ftp://ftp.math.ohio-state.edu/pub/users/ilya/os2/sh_dos.zip
.Ve
.Sh "Starting Perl programs under \s-1OS/2\s0 (and \s-1DOS\s0 and...)"
Start your Perl program \fIfoo.pl\fR with arguments \f(CWarg1 arg2 arg3\fR the
same way as on any other platform, by
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        perl foo.pl arg1 arg2 arg3
.Ve
If you want to specify perl options \f(CW-my_opts\fR to the perl itself (as
opposed to to your program), use
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        perl -my_opts foo.pl arg1 arg2 arg3
.Ve
Alternately, if you use \s-1OS/2-\s0ish shell, like \s-1CMD\s0 or 4os2, put
the following at the start of your perl script:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        extproc perl -S -my_opts
.Ve
rename your program to \fIfoo.cmd\fR, and start it by typing
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        foo arg1 arg2 arg3
.Ve
Note that because of stupid \s-1OS/2\s0 limitations the full path of the perl
script is not available when you use \f(CWextproc\fR, thus you are forced to
use \f(CW-S\fR perl switch, and your script should be on path. As a plus
side, if you know a full path to your script, you may still start it
with 
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        perl ../../blah/foo.cmd arg1 arg2 arg3
.Ve
(note that the argument \f(CW-my_opts\fR is taken care of by the \f(CWextproc\fR line
in your script, see the \fI\f(CWextproc\fR manpage on the first line\fR).
.PP
To understand what the above \fImagic\fR does, read perl docs about \f(CW-S\fR
switch \- see the \fIperlrun\fR manpage, and cmdref about \f(CWextproc\fR:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&        view perl perlrun
\&        man perlrun
\&        view cmdref extproc
\&        help extproc
.Ve
or whatever method you prefer.
.PP
There are also endless possibilities to use \fIexecutable extensions\fR of
4os2, \fIassociations\fR of \s-1WPS\s0 and so on... However, if you use
*nixish shell (like \fIsh.exe\fR supplied in the binary distribution),
you need to follow the syntax specified in the section on \fISwitches\fR in the \fIperlrun\fR manpage.
.PP
Note that \fB\-S\fR switch enables a search with additional extensions 
\&\fI.cmd\fR, \fI.btm\fR, \fI.bat\fR, \fI.pl\fR as well.
.Sh "Starting \s-1OS/2\s0 (and \s-1DOS\s0) programs under Perl"
This is what \fIsystem()\fR (see the \f(CWsystem\fR entry in the \fIperlfunc\fR manpage), \f(CW``\fR (see
the section on \fII/O Operators\fR in the \fIperlop\fR manpage), and \fIopen pipe\fR (see the \f(CWopen\fR entry in the \fIperlfunc\fR manpage)
are for. (Avoid \fIexec()\fR (see the \f(CWexec\fR entry in the \fIperlfunc\fR manpage) unless you know what you
do).
.PP
Note however that to use some of these operators you need to have a
sh-syntax shell installed (see the section on \fIPdksh\fR, 
the section on \fIFrequently asked questions\fR), and perl should be able to find it
(see the section on \fI\s-1PERL_SH_DIR\s0\fR).
.PP
The cases when the shell is used are:
.Ip "1" 5
One-argument \fIsystem()\fR (see the \f(CWsystem\fR entry in the \fIperlfunc\fR manpage), \fIexec()\fR (see the \f(CWexec\fR entry in the \fIperlfunc\fR manpage)
with redirection or shell meta-characters;
.Ip "2" 5
Pipe-open (see the \f(CWopen\fR entry in the \fIperlfunc\fR manpage) with the command which contains redirection 
or shell meta-characters;
.Ip "3" 5
Backticks \f(CW``\fR (see the section on \fII/O Operators\fR in the \fIperlop\fR manpage) with the command which contains
redirection or shell meta-characters;
.Ip "4" 5
If the executable called by \fIsystem()\fR/\fIexec()\fR/pipe-\fIopen()\fR/\f(CW``\fR is a script
with the \*(L"magic\*(R" \f(CW#!\fR line or \f(CWextproc\fR line which specifies shell;
.Ip "5" 5
If the executable called by \fIsystem()\fR/\fIexec()\fR/pipe-\fIopen()\fR/\f(CW``\fR is a script
without \*(L"magic\*(R" line, and \f(CW$ENV{EXECSHELL}\fR is set to shell;
.Ip "6" 5
If the executable called by \fIsystem()\fR/\fIexec()\fR/pipe-\fIopen()\fR/\f(CW``\fR is not
found;
.Ip "7" 5
For globbing (see the \f(CWglob\fR entry in the \fIperlfunc\fR manpage, the section on \fII/O Operators\fR in the \fIperlop\fR manpage).
.PP
For the sake of speed for a common case, in the above algorithms 
backslashes in the command name are not considered as shell metacharacters.
.PP
Perl starts scripts which begin with cookies
\f(CWextproc\fR or \f(CW#!\fR directly, without an intervention of shell.  Perl uses the
same algorithm to find the executable as \fIpdksh\fR: if the path
on \f(CW#!\fR line does not work, and contains \f(CW/\fR, then the executable
is searched in \fI.\fR and on \f(CWPATH\fR.  To find arguments for these scripts
Perl uses a different algorithm than \fIpdksh\fR: up to 3 arguments are 
recognized, and trailing whitespace is stripped.
.PP
If a script
does not contain such a cooky, then to avoid calling \fIsh.exe\fR, Perl uses
the same algorithm as \fIpdksh\fR: if \f(CW$ENV{EXECSHELL}\fR is set, the
script is given as the first argument to this command, if not set, then
\f(CW$ENV{COMSPEC} /c\fR is used (or a hardwired guess if \f(CW$ENV{COMSPEC}\fR is
not set).
.PP
If starting scripts directly, Perl will use exactly the same algorithm as for 
the search of script given by \fB\-S\fR command-line option: it will look in
the current directory, then on components of \f(CW$ENV{PATH}\fR using the 
following order of appended extensions: no extension, \fI.cmd\fR, \fI.btm\fR, 
\&\fI.bat\fR, \fI.pl\fR.
.PP
Note that Perl will start to look for scripts only if \s-1OS/2\s0 cannot start the
specified application, thus \f(CWsystem 'blah'\fR will not look for a script if 
there is an executable file \fIblah.exe\fR \fIanywhere\fR on \f(CWPATH\fR.  
.PP
Note also that executable files on \s-1OS/2\s0 can have an arbitrary extension, 
but \fI.exe\fR will be automatically appended if no dot is present in the name.  
The workaround as as simple as that:  since \fIblah.\fR and \fIblah\fR denote the 
same file, to start an executable residing in file \fIn:/bin/blah\fR (no 
extension) give an argument \f(CWn:/bin/blah.\fR to \fIsystem()\fR.
.PP
The last note is that currently it is not straightforward to start \s-1PM\s0 
programs from \s-1VIO\s0 (=text-mode) Perl process and visa versa.  Either ensure
that shell will be used, as in \f(CWsystem 'cmd /c epm'\fR, or start it using
optional arguments to \fIsystem()\fR documented in \f(CWOS2::Process\fR module.  This
is considered a bug and should be fixed soon.
.SH "Frequently asked questions"
.Sh "I cannot run external programs"
.Ip "" 4
Did you run your programs with \f(CW-w\fR switch? See 
the section on \fIStarting \s-1OS/2\s0 (and \s-1DOS\s0) programs under Perl\fR.
.Ip "" 4
Do you try to run \fIinternal\fR shell commands, like \f(CW`copy a b`\fR
(internal for \fIcmd.exe\fR), or \f(CW`glob a*b`\fR (internal for ksh)? You
need to specify your shell explicitly, like \f(CW`cmd /c copy a b`\fR,
since Perl cannot deduce which commands are internal to your shell.
.Sh "I cannot embed perl into my program, or use \fIperl.dll\fR from my program. "
.Ip "Is your program \s-1EMX\s0\-compiled with \f(CW-Zmt -Zcrtdll\fR?" 4
If not, you need to build a stand-alone \s-1DLL\s0 for perl. Contact me, I
did it once. Sockets would not work, as a lot of other stuff.
.Ip "Did you use the \fIExtUtils::Embed\fR manpage?" 4
I had reports it does not work. Somebody would need to fix it.
.Sh "\f(CW``\fR and pipe-\f(CWopen\fR do not work under \s-1DOS\s0."
This may a variant of just the section on \fII cannot run external programs\fR, or a
deeper problem. Basically: you \fIneed\fR \s-1RSX\s0 (see the section on \fIPrerequisites\fR)
for these commands to work, and you may need a port of \fIsh.exe\fR which
understands command arguments. One of such ports is listed in
the section on \fIPrerequisites\fR under \s-1RSX\s0. Do not forget to set variable

.Sh "Automatic binary installation"
The most convenient way of installing perl is via perl installer
\fIinstall.exe\fR. Just follow the instructions, and 99% of the
installation blues would go away. 
.PP
Note however, that you need to have \fIunzip.exe\fR on your path, and
\s-1EMX\s0 environment \fIrunning\fR. The latter means that if you just
installed \s-1EMX\s0, and made all the needed changes to \fIConfig.sys\fR,
you may need to reboot in between. Check \s-1EMX\s0 runtime by running
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        emxrev
.Ve
A folder is created on your desktop which contains some useful
objects.
.PP
\fBThings not taken care of by automatic binary installation:\fR

.PP
\fB\s-1NOTE\s0\fR. Because of a typo the binary installer of 5.00305
would install a variable \f(CWPERL_SHPATH\fR into \fIConfig.sys\fR. Please
remove this variable and put \f(CWthe \fIPERL_SH_DIR\fR\fR manpage instead.
.Sh "Manual binary installation"
As of version 5.00305, \s-1OS/2\s0 perl binary distribution comes split
into 11 components. Unfortunately, to enable configurable binary
installation, the file paths in the zip files are not absolute, but
relative to some directory.
.PP
Note that the extraction with the stored paths is still necessary
(default with unzip, specify \f(CW-d\fR to pkunzip). However, you
need to know where to extract the files. You need also to manually
change entries in \fIConfig.sys\fR to reflect where did you put the
files. Note that if you have some primitive unzipper (like
pkunzip), you may get a lot of warnings/errors during
unzipping. Upgrade to \f(CW(w)unzip\fR.
.PP
Below is the sample of what to do to reproduce the configuration on my
machine:
.Ip "Perl \s-1VIO\s0 and \s-1PM\s0 executables (dynamically linked)" 3
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  unzip perl_exc.zip *.exe *.ico -d f:/emx.add/bin
\&  unzip perl_exc.zip *.dll -d f:/emx.add/dll
.Ve
(have the directories with \f(CW*.exe\fR on \s-1PATH\s0, and \f(CW*.dll\fR on
\s-1LIBPATH\s0);
.Ip "Perl_ \s-1VIO\s0 executable (statically linked)" 3
.Sp
.Vb 1

.Ip "Executables for Perl utilities" 3
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  unzip perl_utl.zip -d f:/emx.add/bin
.Ve
(have the directory on \s-1PATH\s0);
.Ip "Main Perl library" 3
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  unzip perl_mlb.zip -d f:/perllib/lib
.Ve
If this directory is preserved, you do not need to change
anything. However, for perl to find it if it is changed, you need to
\f(CWset PERLLIB_PREFIX\fR in \fIConfig.sys\fR, see the section on \fI\s-1PERLLIB_PREFIX\s0\fR.
.Ip "Additional Perl modules" 3
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  unzip perl_ste.zip -d f:/perllib/lib/site_perl
.Ve
If you do not change this directory, do nothing. Otherwise put this
directory and subdirectory \fI./os2\fR in \f(CWPERLLIB\fR or \f(CWPERL5LIB\fR
variable. Do not use \f(CWPERL5LIB\fR unless you have it set already. See
the section on \fI\s-1ENVIRONMENT\s0\fR in the \fIperl\fR manpage. 
.Ip "Tools to compile Perl modules" 3
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  unzip perl_blb.zip -d f:/perllib/lib
.Ve
If this directory is preserved, you do not need to change
anything. However, for perl to find it if it is changed, you need to
\f(CWset PERLLIB_PREFIX\fR in \fIConfig.sys\fR, see the section on \fI\s-1PERLLIB_PREFIX\s0\fR.
.Ip "Manpages for Perl and utilities" 3
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  unzip perl_man.zip -d f:/perllib/man
.Ve
This directory should better be on \f(CWMANPATH\fR. You need to have a
working man to access these files.
.Ip "Manpages for Perl modules" 3
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  unzip perl_mam.zip -d f:/perllib/man
.Ve
This directory should better be on \f(CWMANPATH\fR. You need to have a
working man to access these files.
.Ip "Source for Perl documentation" 3
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  unzip perl_pod.zip -d f:/perllib/lib
.Ve
This is used by by \f(CWperldoc\fR program (see the \fIperldoc\fR manpage), and may be used to
generate \s-1HTML\s0 documentation usable by \s-1WWW\s0 browsers, and
documentation in zillions of other formats: \f(CWinfo\fR, \f(CWLaTeX\fR,
\f(CWAcrobat\fR, \f(CWFrameMaker\fR and so on.
.Ip "Perl manual in \fI.\s-1INF\s0\fR format" 3
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  unzip perl_inf.zip -d d:/os2/book
.Ve
This directory should better be on \f(CWBOOKSHELF\fR.
.Ip "Pdksh" 3
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  unzip perl_sh.zip -d f:/bin
.Ve
This is used by perl to run external commands which explicitly
require shell, like the commands using \fIredirection\fR and \fIshell
metacharacters\fR. It is also used instead of explicit \fI/bin/sh\fR.
.Sp
Set \f(CWPERL_SH_DIR\fR (see the section on \fI\s-1PERL_SH_DIR\s0\fR) if you move \fIsh.exe\fR from
the above location.
.Sp
\fBNote.\fR It may be possible to use some other sh-compatible shell
(\fInot tested\fR).
.PP
After you installed the components you needed and updated the
\fIConfig.sys\fR correspondingly, you need to hand-edit
\fIConfig.pm\fR. This file resides somewhere deep in the location you
installed your perl library, find it out by
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  perl -MConfig -le "print $INC{'Config.pm'}"
.Ve
You need to correct all the entries which look like file paths (they
currently start with \f(CWf:/\fR).
.Sh "\fBWarning\fR"
The automatic and manual perl installation leave precompiled paths
inside perl executables. While these paths are overwriteable (see
the section on \fI\s-1PERLLIB_PREFIX\s0\fR, the section on \fI\s-1PERL_SH_DIR\s0\fR), one may get better results by
binary editing of paths inside the executables/DLLs.
.SH "Accessing documentation"
Depending on how you built/installed perl you may have (otherwise
identical) Perl documentation in the following formats:
.Sh "\s-1OS/2\s0 \fI.\s-1INF\s0\fR file"
Most probably the most convenient form. Under \s-1OS/2\s0 view it as
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  view perl
\&  view perl perlfunc
\&  view perl less
\&  view perl ExtUtils::MakeMaker
.Ve
(currently the last two may hit a wrong location, but this may improve
soon). Under Win* see the section on \fI\s-1SYNOPSIS\s0\fR.
.PP
If you want to build the docs yourself, and have \fI\s-1OS/2\s0 toolkit\fR, run
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        pod2ipf > perl.ipf
.Ve
in \fI/perllib/lib/pod\fR directory, then
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ipfc /inf perl.ipf
.Ve
(Expect a lot of errors during the both steps.) Now move it on your
\s-1BOOKSHELF\s0 path.
.Sh "Plain text"
If you have perl documentation in the source form, perl utilities
installed, and \s-1GNU\s0 groff installed, you may use 
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        perldoc perlfunc
\&        perldoc less
\&        perldoc ExtUtils::MakeMaker
.Ve
to access the perl documentation in the text form (note that you may get
better results using perl manpages).
.PP
Alternately, try running pod2text on \fI.pod\fR files.
.Sh "Manpages"
If you have man installed on your system, and you installed perl
manpages, use something like this:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        man perlfunc
\&        man 3 less
\&        man ExtUtils.MakeMaker
.Ve
to access documentation for different components of Perl. Start with
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        man perl
.Ve
Note that dot (\fI.\fR) is used as a package separator for documentation
for packages, and as usual, sometimes you need to give the section \- \f(CW3\fR
above \- to avoid shadowing by the \fIless(1) manpage\fR.
.PP
Make sure that the directory \fBabove\fR the directory with manpages is
on our \f(CWMANPATH\fR, like this
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  set MANPATH=c:/man;f:/perllib/man
.Ve
.Sh "\s-1HTML\s0"
If you have some \s-1WWW\s0 browser available, installed the Perl
documentation in the source form, and Perl utilities, you can build
\s-1HTML\s0 docs. Cd to directory with \fI.pod\fR files, and do like this
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        cd f:/perllib/lib/pod
\&        pod2html
.Ve
After this you can direct your browser the file \fIperl.html\fR in this
directory, and go ahead with reading docs, like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        explore file:///f:/perllib/lib/pod/perl.html
.Ve
Alternatively you may be able to get these docs prebuilt from \s-1CPAN\s0.
.Sh "\s-1GNU\s0 \f(CWinfo\fR files"
Users of Emacs would appreciate it very much, especially with
\f(CWCPerl\fR mode loaded. You need to get latest \f(CWpod2info\fR from \f(CWCPAN\fR,
or, alternately, prebuilt info pages.
.Sh "\fI.\s-1PDF\s0\fR files"
for \f(CWAcrobat\fR are available on \s-1CPAN\s0 (for slightly old version of
perl).
.Sh "\f(CWLaTeX\fR docs"
can be constructed using \f(CWpod2latex\fR.
.SH "BUILD"
Here we discuss how to build Perl under OS/2. There is an alternative
(but maybe older) view on the section on \fI/www.shadow.net/~troc/os2perl.html\fR in the \fIhttp:\fR manpage.
.Sh "Prerequisites"
You need to have the latest \s-1EMX\s0 development environment, the full
\s-1GNU\s0 tool suite (gawk renamed to awk, and \s-1GNU\s0 \fIfind.exe\fR
earlier on path than the \s-1OS/2\s0 \fIfind.exe\fR, same with \fIsort.exe\fR, to
check use
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  find --version
\&  sort --version
.Ve
). You need the latest version of \fIpdksh\fR installed as \fIsh.exe\fR.
.PP
Check that you have \fB\s-1BSD\s0\fR libraries and headers installed, and \- 
optionally \- Berkeley \s-1DB\s0 headers and libraries, and crypt.
.PP
Possible locations to get this from are
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  ftp://hobbes.nmsu.edu/os2/unix/
\&  ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/os2/unix/
\&  ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/os2/dev32/
\&  ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/os2/emx09c/
.Ve
It is reported that the following archives contain enough utils to
build perl: gnufutil.zip, gnusutil.zip, gnututil.zip, gnused.zip,
gnupatch.zip, gnuawk.zip, gnumake.zip and ksh527rt.zip.  Note that
all these utilities are known to be available from \s-1LEO\s0:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  ftp://ftp.leo.org/pub/comp/os/os2/leo/gnu
.Ve
Make sure that no copies or perl are currently running.  Later steps
of the build may fail since an older version of perl.dll loaded into
memory may be found. 
.PP
Also make sure that you have \fI/tmp\fR directory on the current drive,
and \fI.\fR directory in your \f(CWLIBPATH\fR. One may try to correct the
latter condition by
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  set BEGINLIBPATH .
.Ve
if you use something like \fI\s-1CMD\s0.\s-1EXE\s0\fR or latest versions of \fI4os2.exe\fR.
.PP
Make sure your gcc is good for \f(CW-Zomf\fR linking: run \f(CWomflibs\fR
script in \fI/emx/lib\fR directory.
.PP
Check that you have link386 installed. It comes standard with \s-1OS/2\s0,
but may be not installed due to customization. If typing
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  link386
.Ve
shows you do not have it, do \fISelective install\fR, and choose \f(CWLink
object modules\fR in \fIOptional system utilities/More\fR. If you get into
link386, press \f(CWCtrl-C\fR.
.Sh "Getting perl source"
You need to fetch the latest perl source (including developers
releases). With some probability it is located in 
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  http://www.perl.com/CPAN/src/5.0
\&  http://www.perl.com/CPAN/src/5.0/unsupported
.Ve
If not, you may need to dig in the indices to find it in the directory
of the current maintainer.
.PP
Quick cycle of developers release may break the \s-1OS/2\s0 build time to
time, looking into 
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  http://www.perl.com/CPAN/ports/os2/ilyaz/
.Ve
may indicate the latest release which was publicly released by the
maintainer. Note that the release may include some additional patches
to apply to the current source of perl.
.PP
Extract it like this
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  tar vzxf perl5.00409.tar.gz
.Ve
You may see a message about errors while extracting \fIConfigure\fR. This is
because there is a conflict with a similarly-named file \fIconfigure\fR.
.PP
Change to the directory of extraction.
.Sh "Application of the patches"
You need to apply the patches in \fI./os2/diff.*\fR and
\&\fI./os2/\s-1POSIX\s0.mkfifo\fR like this:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  gnupatch -p0 < os2\ePOSIX.mkfifo
\&  gnupatch -p0 < os2\ediff.configure
.Ve
You may also need to apply the patches supplied with the binary
distribution of perl.
.PP
Note also that the \fIdb.lib\fR and \fIdb.a\fR from the \s-1EMX\s0 distribution
are not suitable for multi-threaded compile (note that currently perl
is not multithread-safe, but is compiled as multithreaded for
compatibility with XFree86-\s-1OS/2\s0). Get a corrected one from
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  ftp://ftp.math.ohio-state.edu/pub/users/ilya/os2/db_mt.zip

At some moment the built may die, reporting a \fIversion mismatch\fR or

finished, and it is the time to move the constructed \fIperl.dll\fR to
some \fIabsolute\fR location in \s-1LIBPATH\s0. After this is done the build
should finish without a lot of fuss. \fIOne can avoid the interruption
if one has the correct prebuilt version of \fIperl.dll\fR on \s-1LIBPATH\s0, but
probably this is not needed anymore, since \fIminiperl.exe\fR is linked

However the test engine bleeds these message to screen in unexpected

.PP
Two \fIlib/io_*\fR tests may generate popups (system error \f(CWSYS3175\fR), 
but should succeed anyway.  This is due to a bug of \s-1EMX\s0 related to

.PP
I submitted a patch to \s-1EMX\s0 which makes it possible to \fIfork()\fR with \s-1EMX\s0

.Sh "Problems with tr or sed"
reported with very old version of tr and sed.
.Sh "Some problem (forget which ;\-)"
You have an older version of \fIperl.dll\fR on your \s-1LIBPATH\s0, which
broke the build of extensions.
.Sh "Library ... not found"
You did not run \f(CWomflibs\fR. See the \fIPrerequisites\fR manpage.

emulated by perl.  To disable the emulations, set environment variable
\f(CWUSE_PERL_FLOCK=0\fR.
.SH "Perl flavors"
Because of idiosyncrasies of OS/2 one cannot have all the eggs in the
same basket (though EMX environment tries hard to overcome this
limitations, so the situation may somehow improve). There are 4
executables for Perl provided by the distribution:
.Sh "\fIperl.exe\fR"
The main workhorse. This is a chimera executable: it is compiled as an
\f(CWa.out\fR\-style executable, but is linked with \f(CWomf\fR\-style dynamic
library \fIperl.dll\fR, and with dynamic \s-1CRT\s0 \s-1DLL\s0. This executable is a
\s-1VIO\s0 application.
.PP
It can load perl dynamic extensions, and it can \fIfork()\fR. Unfortunately,
with the current version of \s-1EMX\s0 it cannot \fIfork()\fR with dynamic
extensions loaded (may be fixed by patches to \s-1EMX\s0).
.PP
\fBNote.\fR Keep in mind that \fIfork()\fR is needed to open a pipe to yourself.
.Sh "\fIperl_.exe\fR"
This is a statically linked \f(CWa.out\fR\-style executable. It can \fIfork()\fR,
but cannot load dynamic Perl extensions. The supplied executable has a
lot of extensions prebuilt, thus there are situations when it can
perform tasks not possible using \fIperl.exe\fR, like \fIfork()\fRing when
having some standard extension loaded. This executable is a \s-1VIO\s0
application.
.PP
\fBNote.\fR A better behaviour could be obtained from \f(CWperl.exe\fR if it
were statically linked with standard \fIPerl extensions\fR, but
dynamically linked with the \fIPerl \s-1DLL\s0\fR and \s-1CRT\s0 \s-1DLL\s0. Then it would
be able to \fIfork()\fR with standard extensions, \fIand\fR would be able to
dynamically load arbitrary extensions. Some changes to Makefiles and
hint files should be necessary to achieve this.
.PP
\fIThis is also the only executable with does not require \s-1OS/2\s0.\fR The
friends locked into \f(CWM$\fR world would appreciate the fact that this
executable runs under \s-1DOS\s0, Win0.3*, Win0.95 and WinNT with an
appropriate extender. See the section on \fIOther OSes\fR.
.Sh "\fIperl_\|_.exe\fR"
This is the same executable as \fIperl_\|__.exe\fR, but it is a \s-1PM\s0
application. 
.PP
\fBNote.\fR Usually \s-1STDIN\s0, \s-1STDERR\s0, and \s-1STDOUT\s0 of a \s-1PM\s0
application are redirected to \f(CWnul\fR. However, it is possible to see
them if you start \f(CWperl__.exe\fR from a \s-1PM\s0 program which emulates a
console window, like \fIShell mode\fR of Emacs or \s-1EPM\s0. Thus it \fIis
possible\fR to use Perl debugger (see the \fIperldebug\fR manpage) to debug your \s-1PM\s0
application.
.PP
This flavor is required if you load extensions which use \s-1PM\s0, like
the forthcoming \f(CWPerl/Tk\fR.
.Sh "\fIperl_\|__.exe\fR"
This is an \f(CWomf\fR\-style executable which is dynamically linked to
\fIperl.dll\fR and \s-1CRT\s0 \s-1DLL\s0. I know no advantages of this executable
over \f(CWperl.exe\fR, but it cannot \fIfork()\fR at all. Well, one advantage is
that the build process is not so convoluted as with \f(CWperl.exe\fR.
.PP
It is a \s-1VIO\s0 application.
.Sh "Why strange names?"
Since Perl processes the \f(CW#!\fR\-line (cf. 
the \f(CWDESCRIPTION\fR entry in the \fIperlrun\fR manpage, the \f(CWSwitches\fR entry in the \fIperlrun\fR manpage,
the section on \fINot a perl script\fR in the \fIperldiag\fR manpage, 
the section on \fINo Perl script found in input\fR in the \fIperldiag\fR manpage), it should know when a
program \fIis a Perl\fR. There is some naming convention which allows
Perl to distinguish correct lines from wrong ones. The above names are
almost the only names allowed by this convention which do not contain
digits (which have absolutely different semantics).
.Sh "Why dynamic linking?"
Well, having several executables dynamically linked to the same huge
library has its advantages, but this would not substantiate the
additional work to make it compile. The reason is stupid-but-quick
\*(L"hard\*(R" dynamic linking used by \s-1OS/2\s0.
.PP
The address tables of DLLs are patched only once, when they are
loaded. The addresses of entry points into DLLs are guaranteed to be
the same for all programs which use the same \s-1DLL\s0, which reduces the
amount of runtime patching \- once \s-1DLL\s0 is loaded, its code is
read-only.
.PP
While this allows some performance advantages, this makes life
terrible for developers, since the above scheme makes it impossible
for a \s-1DLL\s0 to be resolved to a symbol in the .\s-1EXE\s0 file, since this
would need a \s-1DLL\s0 to have different relocations tables for the
executables which use it.
.PP
However, a Perl extension is forced to use some symbols from the perl
executable, say to know how to find the arguments provided on the perl
internal evaluation stack. The solution is that the main code of
interpreter should be contained in a \s-1DLL\s0, and the \fI.\s-1EXE\s0\fR file just loads
this \s-1DLL\s0 into memory and supplies command-arguments.
.PP
This \fIgreatly\fR increases the load time for the application (as well as
the number of problems during compilation). Since interpreter is in a \s-1DLL\s0,
the \s-1CRT\s0 is basically forced to reside in a \s-1DLL\s0 as well (otherwise
extensions would not be able to use \s-1CRT\s0).
.Sh "Why chimera build?"
Current \s-1EMX\s0 environment does not allow DLLs compiled using Unixish
\f(CWa.out\fR format to export symbols for data. This forces \f(CWomf\fR\-style
compile of \fIperl.dll\fR.
.PP
Current \s-1EMX\s0 environment does not allow \fI.\s-1EXE\s0\fR files compiled in
\f(CWomf\fR format to \fIfork()\fR. \fIfork()\fR is needed for exactly three Perl
operations:
.Ip "explicit fork()" 4
in the script, and
.Ip "open \s-1FH\s0, \*(N"|\-\*(T"" 4
.Ip "open \s-1FH\s0, \*(N"\-|\*(T"" 4
opening pipes to itself.
.PP
While these operations are not questions of life and death, a lot of
useful scripts use them. This forces \f(CWa.out\fR\-style compile of
\fIperl.exe\fR.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
Here we list environment variables with are either OS/2- and DOS\- and
Win*\-specific, or are more important under OS/2 than under other OSes.
.Sh "\f(CWPERLLIB_PREFIX\fR"
Specific for \s-1EMX\s0 port. Should have the form
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  path1;path2
.Ve
or
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  path1 path2
.Ve
If the beginning of some prebuilt path matches \fIpath1\fR, it is
substituted with \fIpath2\fR.
.PP
Should be used if the perl library is moved from the default
location in preference to \f(CWPERL(5)LIB\fR, since this would not leave wrong
entries in \f(CW@INC\fR.  Say, if the compiled version of perl looks for \f(CW@INC\fR
in \fIf:/perllib/lib\fR, and you want to install the library in
\fIh:/opt/gnu\fR, do
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  set PERLLIB_PREFIX=f:/perllib/lib;h:/opt/gnu
.Ve
.Sh "\f(CWPERL_BADLANG\fR"
If 1, perl ignores \fIsetlocale()\fR failing. May be useful with some
strange \fIlocale\fRs.
.Sh "\f(CWPERL_BADFREE\fR"
If 1, perl would not warn of in case of unwarranted \fIfree()\fR. May be
useful in conjunction with the module DB_File, since Berkeley \s-1DB\s0
memory handling code is buggy.
.Sh "\f(CWPERL_SH_DIR\fR"
Specific for \s-1EMX\s0 port. Gives the directory part of the location for
\fIsh.exe\fR.
.Sh "\f(CWUSE_PERL_FLOCK\fR"
Specific for \s-1EMX\s0 port. Since the \fIflock(3)\fR manpage is present in \s-1EMX\s0, but is not 
functional, it is emulated by perl.  To disable the emulations, set 
environment variable \f(CWUSE_PERL_FLOCK=0\fR.
.Sh "\f(CWTMP\fR or \f(CWTEMP\fR"
Specific for \s-1EMX\s0 port. Used as storage place for temporary files, most
notably \f(CW-e\fR scripts.
.SH "Evolution"
Here we list major changes which could make you by surprise.
.Sh "Priorities"
\f(CWsetpriority\fR and \f(CWgetpriority\fR are not compatible with earlier
ports by Andreas Kaiser. See \f(CW"setpriority, getpriority"\fR.
.Sh "\s-1DLL\s0 name mangling"
With the release 5.003_01 the dynamically loadable libraries
should be rebuilt. In particular, DLLs are now created with the names
which contain a checksum, thus allowing workaround for \s-1OS/2\s0 scheme of
caching DLLs.
.Sh "Threading"
As of release 5.003_01 perl is linked to multithreaded \s-1CRT\s0
\s-1DLL\s0.  If perl itself is not compiled multithread-enabled, so will not be perl
\fImalloc()\fR. However, extensions may use multiple thread on their own
risk. 
.PP
Needed to compile \f(CWPerl/Tk\fR for XFree86-\s-1OS/2\s0 out-of-the-box.
.Sh "Calls to external programs"
Due to a popular demand the perl external program calling has been
changed wrt Andreas Kaiser's port.  \fIIf\fR perl needs to call an
external program \fIvia shell\fR, the \fIf:/bin/sh.exe\fR will be called, or
whatever is the override, see the section on \fI\s-1PERL_SH_DIR\s0\fR.
.PP
Thus means that you need to get some copy of a \fIsh.exe\fR as well (I
use one from pdksh). The drive \fIF:\fR above is set up automatically during
the build to a correct value on the builder machine, but is
overridable at runtime,
.PP
\fBReasons:\fR a consensus on \f(CWperl5-porters\fR was that perl should use
one non-overridable shell per platform. The obvious choices for \s-1OS/2\s0
are \fIcmd.exe\fR and \fIsh.exe\fR. Having perl build itself would be impossible
with \fIcmd.exe\fR as a shell, thus I picked up \f(CWsh.exe\fR. Thus assures almost
100% compatibility with the scripts coming from *nix. As an added benefit 
this works as well under \s-1DOS\s0 if you use \s-1DOS\s0\-enabled port of pdksh 
(see the section on \fIPrerequisites\fR).
.PP
\fBDisadvantages:\fR currently \fIsh.exe\fR of pdksh calls external programs
via \fIfork()\fR/\fIexec()\fR, and there is \fIno\fR functioning \fIexec()\fR on
\s-1OS/2\s0. \fIexec()\fR is emulated by \s-1EMX\s0 by asyncroneous call while the caller
waits for child completion (to pretend that the \f(CWpid\fR did not change). This
means that 1 \fIextra\fR copy of \fIsh.exe\fR is made active via \fIfork()\fR/\fIexec()\fR,
which may lead to some resources taken from the system (even if we do
not count extra work needed for \fIfork()\fRing).
.PP
Note that this a lesser issue now when we do not spawn \fIsh.exe\fR
unless needed (metachars found).
.PP
One can always start \fIcmd.exe\fR explicitly via
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  system 'cmd', '/c', 'mycmd', 'arg1', 'arg2', ...
.Ve
If you need to use \fIcmd.exe\fR, and do not want to hand-edit thousands of your
scripts, the long-term solution proposed on p5-p is to have a directive
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  use OS2::Cmd;
.Ve
which will override \fIsystem()\fR, \fIexec()\fR, \f(CW``\fR, and
\f(CWopen(,'...|')\fR. With current perl you may override only \fIsystem()\fR,
\fIreadpipe()\fR \- the explicit version of \f(CW``\fR, and maybe \fIexec()\fR. The code
will substitute the one-argument call to \fIsystem()\fR by
\f(CWCORE::system('cmd.exe', '/c', shift)\fR.
.PP
If you have some working code for \f(CWOS2::Cmd\fR, please send it to me,
I will include it into distribution. I have no need for such a module, so
cannot test it.
.PP
For the details of the current situation with calling external programs,
see the section on \fIStarting \s-1OS/2\s0 (and \s-1DOS\s0) programs under Perl\fR.
.Ip "" 5
External scripts may be called by name.  Perl will try the same extensions
as when processing \fB\-S\fR command-line switch.
.Sh "Memory allocation"
Perl uses its own \fImalloc()\fR under \s-1OS/2\s0 \- interpreters are usually malloc-bound
for speed, but perl is not, since its malloc is lightning-fast.
Perl-memory-usage-tuned benchmarks show that Perl's malloc is 5 times quickier
than \s-1EMX\s0 one.  I do not have convincing data about memory footpring, but
a (pretty random) benchmark showed that Perl one is 5% better.
.PP
Combination of perl's \fImalloc()\fR and rigid \s-1DLL\s0 name resolution creates
a special problem with library functions which expect their return value to
be \fIfree()\fRd by system's \fIfree()\fR. To facilitate extensions which need to call 
such functions, system memory-allocation functions are still available with
the prefix \f(CWemx_\fR added. (Currently only \s-1DLL\s0 perl has this, it should 
propagate to \fIperl_.exe\fR shortly.)
.Sh "Threads"
One can build perl with thread support enabled by providing \f(CW-D usethreads\fR
option to \fIConfigure\fR.  Currently \s-1OS/2\s0 support of threads is very 
preliminary.
.PP
Most notable problems: 
.Ip "\f(CWCOND_WAIT\fR " 5
may have a race condition.  Needs a reimplementation (in terms of chaining
waiting threads, with linker list stored in per-thread structure?).
.Ip "\fIos2.c\fR" 5
has a couple of static variables used in \s-1OS/2-\s0specific functions.  (Need to be
moved to per-thread structure, or serialized?)
.PP
Note that these problems should not discourage experimenting, since they
have a low probability of affecting small programs.
