.SH "NAME"
perlfaq \- frequently asked questions about Perl ($Date: 1998/08/05 12:09:32 $)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This document is structured into the following sections:
.Ip "perlfaq: Structural overview of the \s-1FAQ\s0." 5
This document.
.Ip "the \fIperlfaq1\fR manpage: General Questions About Perl" 5
Very general, high-level information about Perl.
.Ip "the \fIperlfaq2\fR manpage: Obtaining and Learning about Perl" 5
Where to find source and documentation to Perl, support,
and related matters.
.Ip "the \fIperlfaq3\fR manpage: Programming Tools" 5
Programmer tools and programming support.
.Ip "the \fIperlfaq4\fR manpage: Data Manipulation" 5
Manipulating numbers, dates, strings, arrays, hashes, and
miscellaneous data issues.
.Ip "the \fIperlfaq5\fR manpage: Files and Formats" 5
I/O and the \*(L"f\*(R" issues: filehandles, flushing, formats and footers.
.Ip "the \fIperlfaq6\fR manpage: Regexps" 5
Pattern matching and regular expressions.
.Ip "the \fIperlfaq7\fR manpage: General Perl Language Issues" 5
General Perl language issues that don't clearly fit into any of the
other sections.
.Ip "the \fIperlfaq8\fR manpage: System Interaction" 5
Interprocess communication (\s-1IPC\s0), control over the user-interface
(keyboard, screen and pointing devices).
.Ip "the \fIperlfaq9\fR manpage: Networking" 5
Networking, the Internet, and a few on the web.
.Sh "Where to get this document"
This document is posted regularly to comp.lang.perl.announce and
several other related newsgroups.  It is available in a variety of
formats from \s-1CPAN\s0 in the /\s-1CPAN/\s0doc/FAQs/\s-1FAQ\s0/ directory, or on the web
at http://www.perl.com/perl/faq/ .
.Sh "How to contribute to this document"
You may mail corrections, additions, and suggestions to
perlfaq-suggestions@perl.com .  This alias should not be 
used to \fIask\fR FAQs.  It's for fixing the current \s-1FAQ\s0.
.Sh "What will happen if you mail your Perl programming problems to the authors"
Your questions will probably go unread, unless they're suggestions of
new questions to add to the \s-1FAQ\s0, in which case they should have gone
to the perlfaq-suggestions@perl.com instead.
.PP
You should have read section 2 of this faq.  There you would have
learned that comp.lang.perl.misc is the appropriate place to go for
free advice.  If your question is really important and you require a
prompt and correct answer, you should hire a consultant.
.SH "Credits"
When I first began the Perl FAQ in the late 80s, I never realized it
would have grown to over a hundred pages, nor that Perl would ever become
so popular and widespread.  This document could not have been written
without the tremendous help provided by Larry Wall and the rest of the
Perl Porters.
