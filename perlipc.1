.SH "NAME"
.IX Header "NAME"
perlipc \- Perl interprocess communication (signals, fifos, pipes, safe subprocesses, sockets, and semaphores)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The basic IPC facilities of Perl are built out of the good old Unix
signals, named pipes, pipe opens, the Berkeley socket routines, and SysV
IPC calls.  Each is used in slightly different situations.
.SH "Signals"
.IX Header "Signals"
Perl uses a simple signal handling model: the \f(CW%SIG\fR hash contains names or
references of user-installed signal handlers.  These handlers will be called
with an argument which is the name of the signal that triggered it.  A
signal may be generated intentionally from a particular keyboard sequence like
control-C or control-Z, sent to you from another process, or
triggered automatically by the kernel when special events transpire, like
a child process exiting, your process running out of stack space, or
hitting file size limit.
.PP
For example, to trap an interrupt signal, set up a handler like this.
Do as little as you possibly can in your handler; notice how all we do is
set a global variable and then raise an exception.  That's because on most
systems, libraries are not re-entrant; particularly, memory allocation and
I/O routines are not.  That means that doing nearly \fIanything\fR in your
handler could in theory trigger a memory fault and subsequent core dump.
.PP
.Vb 7
\&    sub catch_zap {
\&        my $signame = shift;
\&        $shucks++;
\&        die "Somebody sent me a SIG$signame";
\&    }
\&    $SIG{INT} = 'catch_zap';  # could fail in modules
\&    $SIG{INT} = \e&catch_zap;  # best strategy
.Ve
The names of the signals are the ones listed out by \f(CWkill -l\fR on your
system, or you can retrieve them from the Config module.  Set up an
\f(CW@signame\fR list indexed by number to get the name and a \f(CW%signo\fR table
indexed by name to get the number:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&    use Config;
\&    defined $Config{sig_name} || die "No sigs?";
\&    foreach $name (split(' ', $Config{sig_name})) {
\&        $signo{$name} = $i;
\&        $signame[$i] = $name;
\&        $i++;
\&    }
.Ve
So to check whether signal 17 and SIGALRM were the same, do just this:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    print "signal #17 = $signame[17]\en";
\&    if ($signo{ALRM}) {
\&        print "SIGALRM is $signo{ALRM}\en";
\&    }
.Ve
You may also choose to assign the strings \f(CW'IGNORE'\fR or \f(CW'DEFAULT'\fR as
the handler, in which case Perl will try to discard the signal or do the
default thing.  Some signals can be neither trapped nor ignored, such as
the KILL and STOP (but not the TSTP) signals.  One strategy for
temporarily ignoring signals is to use a \fIlocal()\fR statement, which will be
automatically restored once your block is exited.  (Remember that \fIlocal()\fR
values are \*(L"inherited\*(R" by functions called from within that block.)
.PP
.Vb 7
\&    sub precious {
\&        local $SIG{INT} = 'IGNORE';
\&        &more_functions;
\&    }
\&    sub more_functions {
\&        # interrupts still ignored, for now...
\&    }
.Ve
Sending a signal to a negative process ID means that you send the signal
to the entire Unix process-group.  This code send a hang-up signal to all
processes in the current process group \fIexcept for\fR the current process
itself:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    {
\&        local $SIG{HUP} = 'IGNORE';
\&        kill HUP => -$$;
\&        # snazzy writing of: kill('HUP', -$$)
\&    }
.Ve
Another interesting signal to send is signal number zero.  This doesn't
actually affect another process, but instead checks whether it's alive
or has changed its UID.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    unless (kill 0 => $kid_pid) {
\&        warn "something wicked happened to $kid_pid";
\&    }
.Ve
You might also want to employ anonymous functions for simple signal
handlers:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $SIG{INT} = sub { die "\enOutta here!\en" };
.Ve
But that will be problematic for the more complicated handlers that need
to reinstall themselves.  Because Perl's signal mechanism is currently
based on the \fIsignal\fR\|(3) function from the C library, you may sometimes be so
misfortunate as to run on systems where that function is \*(L"broken\*(R", that
is, it behaves in the old unreliable SysV way rather than the newer, more
reasonable BSD and POSIX fashion.  So you'll see defensive people writing
signal handlers like this:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&    sub REAPER {
\&        $waitedpid = wait;
\&        # loathe sysV: it makes us not only reinstate
\&        # the handler, but place it after the wait
\&        $SIG{CHLD} = \e&REAPER;
\&    }
\&    $SIG{CHLD} = \e&REAPER;
\&    # now do something that forks...
.Ve
or even the more elaborate:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&    use POSIX ":sys_wait_h";
\&    sub REAPER {
\&        my $child;
\&        while ($child = waitpid(-1,WNOHANG)) {
\&            $Kid_Status{$child} = $?;
\&        }
\&        $SIG{CHLD} = \e&REAPER;  # still loathe sysV
\&    }
\&    $SIG{CHLD} = \e&REAPER;
\&    # do something that forks...
.Ve
Signal handling is also used for timeouts in Unix,   While safely
protected within an \f(CWeval{}\fR block, you set a signal handler to trap
alarm signals and then schedule to have one delivered to you in some
number of seconds.  Then try your blocking operation, clearing the alarm
when it's done but not before you've exited your \f(CWeval{}\fR block.  If it
goes off, you'll use \fIdie()\fR to jump out of the block, much as you might
using \fIlongjmp()\fR or \fIthrow()\fR in other languages.
.PP
Here's an example:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&    eval {
\&        local $SIG{ALRM} = sub { die "alarm clock restart" };
\&        alarm 10;
\&        flock(FH, 2);   # blocking write lock
\&        alarm 0;
\&    };
\&    if ($@ and $@ !~ /alarm clock restart/) { die }
.Ve
For more complex signal handling, you might see the standard POSIX
module.  Lamentably, this is almost entirely undocumented, but
the \fIt/lib/posix.t\fR file from the Perl source distribution has some
examples in it.
.SH "Named Pipes"
.IX Header "Named Pipes"
A named pipe (often referred to as a FIFO) is an old Unix IPC
mechanism for processes communicating on the same machine.  It works
just like a regular, connected anonymous pipes, except that the
processes rendezvous using a filename and don't have to be related.
.PP
To create a named pipe, use the Unix command \fImknod\fR\|(1) or on some
systems, \fImkfifo\fR\|(1).  These may not be in your normal path.
.PP
.Vb 8
\&    # system return val is backwards, so && not ||
\&    #
\&    $ENV{PATH} .= ":/etc:/usr/etc";
\&    if  (      system('mknod',  $path, 'p')
\&            && system('mkfifo', $path) )
\&    {
\&        die "mk{nod,fifo} $path failed;
\&    }
.Ve
A fifo is convenient when you want to connect a process to an unrelated
one.  When you open a fifo, the program will block until there's something
on the other end.
.PP
For example, let's say you'd like to have your \fI.signature\fR file be a
named pipe that has a Perl program on the other end.  Now every time any
program (like a mailer, news reader, finger program, etc.) tries to read
from that file, the reading program will block and your program will
supply the new signature.  We'll use the pipe-checking file test \fB\-p\fR
to find out whether anyone (or anything) has accidentally removed our fifo.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    chdir; # go home
\&    $FIFO = '.signature';
\&    $ENV{PATH} .= ":/etc:/usr/games";
.Ve
.Vb 6
\&    while (1) {
\&        unless (-p $FIFO) {
\&            unlink $FIFO;
\&            system('mknod', $FIFO, 'p')
\&                && die "can't mknod $FIFO: $!";
\&        }
.Ve
.Vb 6
\&        # next line blocks until there's a reader
\&        open (FIFO, "> $FIFO") || die "can't write $FIFO: $!";
\&        print FIFO "John Smith (smith\e@host.org)\en", `fortune -s`;
\&        close FIFO;
\&        sleep 2;    # to avoid dup signals
\&    }
.Ve
.SH "Using \fIopen()\fR for IPC"
.IX Header "Using \fIopen()\fR for IPC"
Perl's basic \fIopen()\fR statement can also be used for unidirectional interprocess
communication by either appending or prepending a pipe symbol to the second
argument to \fIopen()\fR.  Here's how to start something up in a child process you
intend to write to:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    open(SPOOLER, "| cat -v | lpr -h 2>/dev/null")
\&                    || die "can't fork: $!";
\&    local $SIG{PIPE} = sub { die "spooler pipe broke" };
\&    print SPOOLER "stuff\en";
\&    close SPOOLER || die "bad spool: $! $?";
.Ve
And here's how to start up a child process you intend to read from:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&    open(STATUS, "netstat -an 2>&1 |")
\&                    || die "can't fork: $!";
\&    while (<STATUS>) {
\&        next if /^(tcp|udp)/;
\&        print;
\&    }
\&    close STATUS || die "bad netstat: $! $?";
.Ve
If one can be sure that a particular program is a Perl script that is
expecting filenames in \f(CW@ARGV\fR, the clever programmer can write something
like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $ program f1 "cmd1|" - f2 "cmd2|" f3 < tmpfile
.Ve
and irrespective of which shell it's called from, the Perl program will
read from the file \fIf1\fR, the process \fIcmd1\fR, standard input (\fItmpfile\fR
in this case), the \fIf2\fR file, the \fIcmd2\fR command, and finally the \fIf3\fR
file.  Pretty nifty, eh?
.PP
You might notice that you could use backticks for much the
same effect as opening a pipe for reading:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    print grep { !/^(tcp|udp)/ } `netstat -an 2>&1`;
\&    die "bad netstat" if $?;
.Ve
While this is true on the surface, it's much more efficient to process the
file one line or record at a time because then you don't have to read the
whole thing into memory at once. It also gives you finer control of the
whole process, letting you to kill off the child process early if you'd
like.
.PP
Be careful to check both the \fIopen()\fR and the \fIclose()\fR return values.  If
you're \fIwriting\fR to a pipe, you should also trap SIGPIPE.  Otherwise,
think of what happens when you start up a pipe to a command that doesn't
exist: the \fIopen()\fR will in all likelihood succeed (it only reflects the
\fIfork()\fR's success), but then your output will fail\*(--spectacularly.  Perl
can't know whether the command worked because your command is actually
running in a separate process whose \fIexec()\fR might have failed.  Therefore,
while readers of bogus commands return just a quick end of file, writers
to bogus command will trigger a signal they'd better be prepared to
handle.  Consider:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    open(FH, "|bogus");
\&    print FH "bang\en";
\&    close FH;
.Ve
.Sh "Filehandles"
.IX Subsection "Filehandles"
Both the main process and the child process share the same \s-1STDIN\s0,
\s-1STDOUT\s0 and \s-1STDERR\s0 filehandles.  If both processes try to access them
at once, strange things can happen.  You may want to close or reopen
the filehandles for the child.  You can get around this by opening
your pipe with \fIopen()\fR, but on some systems this means that the child
process cannot outlive the parent.
.Sh "Background Processes"
.IX Subsection "Background Processes"
You can run a command in the background with:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    system("cmd &");
.Ve
The command's \s-1STDOUT\s0 and \s-1STDERR\s0 (and possibly \s-1STDIN\s0, depending on your
shell) will be the same as the parent's.  You won't need to catch
\s-1SIGCHLD\s0 because of the double-fork taking place (see below for more
details).
.Sh "Complete Dissociation of Child from Parent"
.IX Subsection "Complete Dissociation of Child from Parent"
In some cases (starting server processes, for instance) you'll want to
complete dissociate the child process from the parent.  The following
process is reported to work on most Unixish systems.  Non-Unix users
should check their Your_OS::Process module for other solutions.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
.IX Item "\(bu"
Open /dev/tty and use the \s-1TIOCNOTTY\s0 ioctl on it.  See the \fItty(4)\fR manpage
for details.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
.IX Item "\(bu"
Change directory to /
.Ip "\(bu" 4
.IX Item "\(bu"
Reopen \s-1STDIN\s0, \s-1STDOUT\s0, and \s-1STDERR\s0 so they're not connected to the old
tty.
.Ip "\(bu" 4
.IX Item "\(bu"
Background yourself like this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    fork && exit;
.Ve
.Sh "Safe Pipe Opens"
.IX Subsection "Safe Pipe Opens"
Another interesting approach to \s-1IPC\s0 is making your single program go
multiprocess and communicate between (or even amongst) yourselves.  The
\fIopen()\fR function will accept a file argument of either \f(CW"-|"\fR or \f(CW"|-"\fR
to do a very interesting thing: it forks a child connected to the
filehandle you've opened.  The child is running the same program as the
parent.  This is useful for safely opening a file when running under an
assumed \s-1UID\s0 or \s-1GID\s0, for example.  If you open a pipe \fIto\fR minus, you can
write to the filehandle you opened and your kid will find it in his
\s-1STDIN\s0.  If you open a pipe \fIfrom\fR minus, you can read from the filehandle
you opened whatever your kid writes to his \s-1STDOUT\s0.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    use English;
\&    my $sleep_count = 0;
.Ve
.Vb 8
\&    do {
\&        $pid = open(KID_TO_WRITE, "|-");
\&        unless (defined $pid) {
\&            warn "cannot fork: $!";
\&            die "bailing out" if $sleep_count++ > 6;
\&            sleep 10;
\&        }
\&    } until defined $pid;
.Ve
.Vb 12
\&    if ($pid) {  # parent
\&        print KID_TO_WRITE @some_data;
\&        close(KID_TO_WRITE) || warn "kid exited $?";
\&    } else {     # child
\&        ($EUID, $EGID) = ($UID, $GID); # suid progs only
\&        open (FILE, "> /safe/file")
\&            || die "can't open /safe/file: $!";
\&        while (<STDIN>) {
\&            print FILE; # child's STDIN is parent's KID
\&        }
\&        exit;  # don't forget this
\&    }
.Ve
Another common use for this construct is when you need to execute
something without the shell's interference.  With \fIsystem()\fR, it's
straightforward, but you can't use a pipe open or backticks safely.
That's because there's no way to stop the shell from getting its hands on
your arguments.   Instead, use lower-level control to call \fIexec()\fR directly.
.PP
Here's a safe backtick or pipe open for read:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    # add error processing as above
\&    $pid = open(KID_TO_READ, "-|");
.Ve
.Vb 5
\&    if ($pid) {   # parent
\&        while (<KID_TO_READ>) {
\&            # do something interesting
\&        }
\&        close(KID_TO_READ) || warn "kid exited $?";
.Ve
.Vb 6
\&    } else {      # child
\&        ($EUID, $EGID) = ($UID, $GID); # suid only
\&        exec($program, @options, @args)
\&            || die "can't exec program: $!";
\&        # NOTREACHED
\&    }
.Ve
And here's a safe pipe open for writing:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    # add error processing as above
\&    $pid = open(KID_TO_WRITE, "|-");
\&    $SIG{ALRM} = sub { die "whoops, $program pipe broke" };
.Ve
.Vb 5
\&    if ($pid) {  # parent
\&        for (@data) {
\&            print KID_TO_WRITE;
\&        }
\&        close(KID_TO_WRITE) || warn "kid exited $?";
.Ve
.Vb 6
\&    } else {     # child
\&        ($EUID, $EGID) = ($UID, $GID);
\&        exec($program, @options, @args)
\&            || die "can't exec program: $!";
\&        # NOTREACHED
\&    }
.Ve
Note that these operations are full Unix forks, which means they may not be
correctly implemented on alien systems.  Additionally, these are not true
multithreading.  If you'd like to learn more about threading, see the
\fImodules\fR file mentioned below in the \s-1SEE\s0 \s-1ALSO\s0 section.
.Sh "Bidirectional Communication with Another Process"
.IX Subsection "Bidirectional Communication with Another Process"
While this works reasonably well for unidirectional communication, what
about bidirectional communication?  The obvious thing you'd like to do
doesn't actually work:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    open(PROG_FOR_READING_AND_WRITING, "| some program |")
.Ve
and if you forget to use the \fB\-w\fR flag, then you'll miss out
entirely on the diagnostic message:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    Can't do bidirectional pipe at -e line 1.
.Ve
If you really want to, you can use the standard \fIopen2()\fR library function
to catch both ends.  There's also an \fIopen3()\fR for tridirectional I/O so you
can also catch your child's \s-1STDERR\s0, but doing so would then require an
awkward \fIselect()\fR loop and wouldn't allow you to use normal Perl input
operations.
.PP
If you look at its source, you'll see that \fIopen2()\fR uses low-level
primitives like Unix \fIpipe()\fR and \fIexec()\fR to create all the connections.
While it might have been slightly more efficient by using \fIsocketpair()\fR, it
would have then been even less portable than it already is.  The \fIopen2()\fR
and \fIopen3()\fR functions are  unlikely to work anywhere except on a Unix
system or some other one purporting to be \s-1POSIX\s0 compliant.
.PP
Here's an example of using \fIopen2()\fR:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    use FileHandle;
\&    use IPC::Open2;
\&    $pid = open2( \e*Reader, \e*Writer, "cat -u -n" );
\&    Writer->autoflush(); # default here, actually
\&    print Writer "stuff\en";
\&    $got = <Reader>;
.Ve
The problem with this is that Unix buffering is really going to
ruin your day.  Even though your \f(CWWriter\fR filehandle is auto-flushed,
and the process on the other end will get your data in a timely manner,
you can't usually do anything to force it to give it back to you
in a similarly quick fashion.  In this case, we could, because we
gave \fIcat\fR a \fB\-u\fR flag to make it unbuffered.  But very few Unix
commands are designed to operate over pipes, so this seldom works
unless you yourself wrote the program on the other end of the
double-ended pipe.
.PP
A solution to this is the nonstandard \fIComm.pl\fR library.  It uses
pseudo-ttys to make your program behave more reasonably:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    require 'Comm.pl';
\&    $ph = open_proc('cat -n');
\&    for (1..10) {
\&        print $ph "a line\en";
\&        print "got back ", scalar <$ph>;
\&    }
.Ve
This way you don't have to have control over the source code of the
program you're using.  The \fIComm\fR library also has \fIexpect()\fR
and \fIinteract()\fR functions.  Find the library (and we hope its
successor \fI\s-1IPC::\s0Chat\fR) at your nearest \s-1CPAN\s0 archive as detailed
in the \s-1SEE\s0 \s-1ALSO\s0 section below.
.SH "Sockets: Client/Server Communication"
.IX Header "Sockets: Client/Server Communication"
While not limited to Unix-derived operating systems (e.g., WinSock on PCs
provides socket support, as do some VMS libraries), you may not have
sockets on your system, in which case this section probably isn't going to do
you much good.  With sockets, you can do both virtual circuits (i.e., TCP
streams) and datagrams (i.e., UDP packets).  You may be able to do even more
depending on your system.
.PP
The Perl function calls for dealing with sockets have the same names as
the corresponding system calls in C, but their arguments tend to differ
for two reasons: first, Perl filehandles work differently than C file
descriptors.  Second, Perl already knows the length of its strings, so you
don't need to pass that information.
.PP
One of the major problems with old socket code in Perl was that it used
hard-coded values for some of the constants, which severely hurt
portability.  If you ever see code that does anything like explicitly
setting \f(CW$AF_INET = 2\fR, you know you're in for big trouble:  An
immeasurably superior approach is to use the \f(CWSocket\fR module, which more
reliably grants access to various constants and functions you'll need.
.PP
If you're not writing a server/client for an existing protocol like
NNTP or SMTP, you should give some thought to how your server will
know when the client has finished talking, and vice-versa.  Most
protocols are based on one-line messages and responses (so one party
knows the other has finished when a \*(L"\en\*(R" is received) or multi-line
messages and responses that end with a period on an empty line
(\*(R"\en.\en\*(R" terminates a message/response).
.Sh "Internet \s-1TCP\s0 Clients and Servers"
.IX Subsection "Internet \s-1TCP\s0 Clients and Servers"
Use Internet-domain sockets when you want to do client-server
communication that might extend to machines outside of your own system.
.PP
Here's a sample \s-1TCP\s0 client using Internet-domain sockets:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    #!/usr/bin/perl -w
\&    require 5.002;
\&    use strict;
\&    use Socket;
\&    my ($remote,$port, $iaddr, $paddr, $proto, $line);
.Ve
.Vb 6
\&    $remote  = shift || 'localhost';
\&    $port    = shift || 2345;  # random port
\&    if ($port =~ /\eD/) { $port = getservbyname($port, 'tcp') }
\&    die "No port" unless $port;
\&    $iaddr   = inet_aton($remote)               || die "no host: $remote";
\&    $paddr   = sockaddr_in($port, $iaddr);
.Ve
.Vb 6
\&    $proto   = getprotobyname('tcp');
\&    socket(SOCK, PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, $proto)  || die "socket: $!";
\&    connect(SOCK, $paddr)    || die "connect: $!";

\&    }
.Ve
.Vb 2
\&    close (SOCK)            || die "close: $!";
\&    exit;
.Ve
And here's a corresponding server to go along with it.  We'll
leave the address as \s-1INADDR_ANY\s0 so that the kernel can choose
the appropriate interface on multihomed hosts.  If you want sit
on a particular interface (like the external side of a gateway
or firewall machine), you should fill this in with your real address
instead.

like most typical servers, it spawns (forks) a slave server to
handle the client request so that the master server can quickly
go back to service a new client.

This server takes the trouble to clone off a child version via \fIfork()\fR for
each incoming request.  That way it can handle many requests at once,
which you might not always want.  Even if you don't \fIfork()\fR, the \fIlisten()\fR
will allow that many pending connections.  Forking servers have to be
particularly careful about cleaning up their dead children (called
\*(L"zombies\*(R" in Unix parlance), because otherwise you'll quickly fill up your
process table.
.PP
We suggest that you use the \fB\-T\fR flag to use taint checking (see the \fIperlsec\fR manpage)
even if we aren't running setuid or setgid.  This is always a good idea
for servers and other programs run on behalf of someone else (like \s-1CGI\s0
scripts), because it lessens the chances that people from the outside will
be able to compromise your system.
.PP
Let's look at another \s-1TCP\s0 client.  This one connects to the \s-1TCP\s0 \*(L"time\*(R"

differ from the system on which it's being run:

That's fine for Internet-domain clients and servers, but what about local
communications?  While you can use the same setup, sometimes you don't
want to.  Unix-domain sockets are local to the current host, and are often
used internally to implement pipes.  Unlike Internet domain sockets, Unix
domain sockets can show up in the file system with an \fIls\fR\|(1) listing.

As you see, it's remarkably similar to the Internet domain \s-1TCP\s0 server, so
much so, in fact, that we've omitted several duplicate functions--\fIspawn()\fR,
\fIlogmsg()\fR, \fIctime()\fR, and \fI\s-1REAPER\s0()\fR--which are exactly the same as in the
other server.

So why would you ever want to use a Unix domain socket instead of a
simpler named pipe?  Because a named pipe doesn't give you sessions.  You
can't tell one process's data from another's.  With socket programming,
you get a separate session for each client: that's why \fIaccept()\fR takes two
arguments.
.PP
For example, let's say that you have a long running database server daemon
that you want folks from the World Wide Web to be able to access, but only
if they go through a \s-1CGI\s0 interface.  You'd have a small, simple \s-1CGI\s0
program that does whatever checks and logging you feel like, and then acts
as a Unix-domain client and connects to your private server.

IO::Socket from CPAN, where you'll also find find modules providing easy

.IX Item "\f(CWProto\fR"
This is which protocol to use.  In this case, the socket handle returned
will be connected to a \s-1TCP\s0 socket, because we want a stream-oriented
connection, that is, one that acts pretty much like a plain old file.
Not all sockets are this of this type.  For example, the \s-1UDP\s0 protocol
can be used to make a datagram socket, used for message-passing.
.Ip "\f(CWPeerAddr\fR" 5
.IX Item "\f(CWPeerAddr\fR"
This is the name or Internet address of the remote host the server is
running on.  We could have specified a longer name like \f(CW"www.perl.com"\fR,
or an address like \f(CW"204.148.40.9"\fR.  For demonstration purposes, we've
used the special hostname \f(CW"localhost"\fR, which should always mean the
current machine you're running on.  The corresponding Internet address
for localhost is \f(CW"127.1"\fR, if you'd rather use that.
.Ip "\f(CWPeerPort\fR" 5
.IX Item "\f(CWPeerPort\fR"
This is the service name or port number we'd like to connect to.
We could have gotten away with using just \f(CW"daytime"\fR on systems with a
well-configured system services file,[\s-1FOOTNOTE\s0: The system services file
is in \fI/etc/services\fR under Unix] but just in case, we've specified the
port number (13) in parentheses.  Using just the number would also have
worked, but constant numbers make careful programmers nervous.
.PP
Notice how the return value from the \f(CWnew\fR constructor is used as
a filehandle in the \f(CWwhile\fR loop?  That's what's called an indirect
filehandle, a scalar variable containing a filehandle.  You can use
it the same way you would a normal filehandle.  For example, you
can read one line from it this way:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $line = <$handle>;
.Ve
all remaining lines from is this way:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    @lines = <$handle>;

and send a line of data to it this way:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    print $handle "some data\en";

.Sh "A Webget Client"
.IX Subsection "A Webget Client"
Here's a simple client that takes a remote host to fetch a document
from, and then a list of documents to get from that host.  This is a
more interesting client than the previous one because it first sends
something to the server before fetching the server's response.
.PP
.Vb 15
\&    #!/usr/bin/perl -w
\&    use IO::Socket;
\&    unless (@ARGV > 1) { die "usage: $0 host document ..." }
\&    $host = shift(@ARGV);
\&    foreach $document ( @ARGV ) {
\&        $remote = IO::Socket::INET->new( Proto     => "tcp",
\&                                         PeerAddr  => $host,
\&                                         PeerPort  => "http(80)",
\&                                        );
\&        unless ($remote) { die "cannot connect to http daemon on $host" }
\&        $remote->autoflush(1);
\&        print $remote "GET $document HTTP/1.0\en\en";
\&        while ( <$remote> ) { print }
\&        close $remote;
\&    }
.Ve
The web server handing the \*(L"http\*(R" service, which is assumed to be at
its standard port, number 80.  If your the web server you're trying to
connect to is at a different port (like 1080 or 8080), you should specify
as the named-parameter pair, \f(CWPeerPort => 8080\fR.  The \f(CWautoflush\fR
method is used on the socket because otherwise the system would buffer
up the output we sent it.  (If you're on a Mac, you'll also need to
change every \f(CW"\en"\fR in your code that sends data over the network to
be a \f(CW"\e015\e012"\fR instead.)
.PP
Connecting to the server is only the first part of the process: once you
have the connection, you have to use the server's language.  Each server
on the network has its own little command language that it expects as
input.  The string that we send to the server starting with \*(L"\s-1GET\s0\*(R" is in
\s-1HTTP\s0 syntax.  In this case, we simply request each specified document.
Yes, we really are making a new connection for each document, even though
it's the same host.  That's the way you always used to have to speak \s-1HTTP\s0.
Recent versions of web browsers may request that the remote server leave
the connection open a little while, but the server doesn't have to honor
such a request.
.PP
Here's an example of running that program, which we'll call \fIwebget\fR:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    shell_prompt$ webget www.perl.com /guanaco.html
\&    HTTP/1.1 404 File Not Found
\&    Date: Thu, 08 May 1997 18:02:32 GMT
\&    Server: Apache/1.2b6
\&    Connection: close
\&    Content-type: text/html
.Ve
.Vb 4
\&    <HEAD><TITLE>404 File Not Found</TITLE></HEAD>
\&    <BODY><H1>File Not Found</H1>
\&    The requested URL /guanaco.html was not found on this server.<P>
\&    </BODY>
.Ve
Ok, so that's not very interesting, because it didn't find that
particular document.  But a long response wouldn't have fit on this page.
.PP
For a more fully-featured version of this program, you should look to
the \fIlwp-request\fR program included with the \s-1LWP\s0 modules from \s-1CPAN\s0.
.Sh "Interactive Client with \s-1IO::\s0Socket"
.IX Subsection "Interactive Client with \s-1IO::\s0Socket"
Well, that's all fine if you want to send one command and get one answer,
but what about setting up something fully interactive, somewhat like
the way \fItelnet\fR works?  That way you can type a line, get the answer,
type a line, get the answer, etc.
.PP
This client is more complicated than the two we've done so far, but if
you're on a system that supports the powerful \f(CWfork\fR call, the solution
isn't that rough.  Once you've made the connection to whatever service
you'd like to chat with, call \f(CWfork\fR to clone your process.  Each of
these two identical process has a very simple job to do: the parent
copies everything from the socket to standard output, while the child
simultaneously copies everything from standard input to the socket.
To accomplish the same thing using just one process would be \fImuch\fR
harder, because it's easier to code two processes to do one thing than it
is to code one process to do two things.  (This keep-it-simple principle
is one of the cornerstones of the Unix philosophy, and good software
engineering as well, which is probably why it's spread to other systems
as well.)
.PP
Here's the code:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    #!/usr/bin/perl -w
\&    use strict;
\&    use IO::Socket;
\&    my ($host, $port, $kidpid, $handle, $line);
.Ve
.Vb 2
\&    unless (@ARGV == 2) { die "usage: $0 host port" }
\&    ($host, $port) = @ARGV;
.Ve
.Vb 5
\&    # create a tcp connection to the specified host and port
\&    $handle = IO::Socket::INET->new(Proto     => "tcp",
\&                                    PeerAddr  => $host,
\&                                    PeerPort  => $port)
\&           or die "can't connect to port $port on $host: $!";

\&    print STDERR "[Connected to $host:$port]\en";
.Ve
.Vb 2
\&    # split the program into two processes, identical twins
\&    die "can't fork: $!" unless defined($kidpid = fork());
.Ve
.Vb 15
\&    # the if{} block runs only in the parent process
\&    if ($kidpid) {
\&        # copy the socket to standard output
\&        while (defined ($line = <$handle>)) {
\&            print STDOUT $line;
\&        }
\&        kill("TERM", $kidpid);                  # send SIGTERM to child
\&    }
\&    # the else{} block runs only in the child process
\&    else {
\&        # copy standard input to the socket
\&        while (defined ($line = <STDIN>)) {
\&            print $handle $line;
\&        }
\&    }
.Ve
The \f(CWkill\fR function in the parent's \f(CWif\fR block is there to send a
signal to our child process (current running in the \f(CWelse\fR block)
as soon as the remote server has closed its end of the connection.
.PP
The \f(CWkill\fR at the end of the parent's block is there to eliminate the
child process as soon as the server we connect to closes its end.
.PP
If the remote server sends data a byte at time, and you need that
data immediately without waiting for a newline (which might not happen),
you may wish to replace the \f(CWwhile\fR loop in the parent with the
following:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    my $byte;
\&    while (sysread($handle, $byte, 1) == 1) {
\&        print STDOUT $byte;
\&    }
.Ve
Making a system call for each byte you want to read is not very efficient
(to put it mildly) but is the simplest to explain and works reasonably
well.
.SH "TCP Servers with IO::Socket"
.IX Header "TCP Servers with IO::Socket"
Setting up server is little bit more involved than running a client.
The model is that the server creates a special kind of socket that
does nothing but listen on a particular port for incoming connections.
It does this by calling the \f(CWIO::Socket::INET->\fInew()\fR\fR method with
slightly different arguments than the client did.
.Ip "Proto" 5
.IX Item "Proto"
This is which protocol to use.  Like our clients, we'll
still specify \f(CW"tcp"\fR here.
.Ip "LocalPort" 5
.IX Item "LocalPort"
We specify a local
port in the \f(CWLocalPort\fR argument, which we didn't do for the client.
This is service name or port number for which you want to be the
server. (Under Unix, ports under 1024 are restricted to the
superuser.)  In our sample, we'll use port 9000, but you can use
any port that's not currently in use on your system.  If you try
to use one already in used, you'll get an \*(L"Address already in use\*(R"
message. Under Unix, the \f(CWnetstat -a\fR command will show
which services current have servers.
.Ip "Listen" 5
.IX Item "Listen"
The \f(CWListen\fR parameter is set to the maximum number of
pending connections we can accept until we turn away incoming clients.
Think of it as a call-waiting queue for your telephone.
The low-level Socket module has a special symbol for the system maximum, which
is \s-1SOMAXCONN\s0.
.Ip "Reuse" 5
.IX Item "Reuse"
The \f(CWReuse\fR parameter is needed so that we restart our server
manually without waiting a few minutes to allow system buffers to
clear out.
.PP
Once the generic server socket has been created using the parameters
listed above, the server then waits for a new client to connect
to it.  The server blocks in the \f(CWaccept\fR method, which eventually an
bidirectional connection to the remote client.  (Make sure to autoflush
this handle to circumvent buffering.)
.PP
To add to user-friendliness, our server prompts the user for commands.
Most servers don't do this.  Because of the prompt without a newline,
you'll have to use the \f(CWsysread\fR variant of the interactive client above.
.PP
This server accepts one of five different commands, sending output
back to the client.  Note that unlike most network servers, this one
only handles one incoming client at a time.  Multithreaded servers are
covered in Chapter 6 of the Camel or in the \fIperlipc\fR\|(1) manpage.

Here's the code.  We'll

.SH "UDP: Message Passing"
.IX Header "UDP: Message Passing"
Another kind of client-server setup is one that uses not connections, but
messages.  UDP communications involve much lower overhead but also provide
less reliability, as there are no promises that messages will arrive at
all, let alone in order and unmangled.  Still, UDP offers some advantages
over TCP, including being able to \*(L"broadcast\*(R" or \*(L"multicast\*(R" to a whole
bunch of destination hosts at once (usually on your local subnet).  If you
find yourself overly concerned about reliability and start building checks
into your message system, then you probably should use just TCP to start
with.
.PP
Here's a UDP program similar to the sample Internet TCP client given
earlier.  However, instead of checking one host at a time, the UDP version
will check many of them asynchronously by simulating a multicast and then
using \fIselect()\fR to do a timed-out wait for I/O.  To do something similar
with TCP, you'd have to use a different socket handle for each host.

All these routines create system-specific portability problems.  As noted
elsewhere, Perl is at the mercy of your C libraries for much of its system
behaviour.  It's probably safest to assume broken SysV semantics for
signals and to stick with simple TCP and UDP socket operations; e.g., don't
try to pass open file descriptors over a local UDP datagram socket if you
want your code to stand a chance of being portable.
.PP
Because few vendors provide C libraries that are safely re-entrant,
the prudent programmer will do little else within a handler beyond
setting a numeric variable that already exists; or, if locked into
a slow (restarting) system call, using \fIdie()\fR to raise an exception
and \fIlongjmp\fR\|(3) out.  In fact, even these may in some cases cause a
core dump.  It's probably best to avoid signals except where they are
absolutely inevitable.  This perilous problems will be addressed in a
future release of Perl.
