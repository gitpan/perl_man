The following is the old c2ph.doc documentation by Tom Christiansen
<tchrist@perl.com>
Date: 25 Jul 91 08:10:21 GMT
.PP
Once upon a time, I wrote a program called pstruct.  It was a perl
program that tried to parse out C structures and display their member
offsets for you.  This was especially useful for people looking at
binary dumps or poking around the kernel.
.PP
Pstruct was not a pretty program.  Neither was it particularly robust.
The problem, you see, was that the C compiler was much better at parsing
C than I could ever hope to be.
.PP
So I got smart:  I decided to be lazy and let the C compiler parse the C,
which would spit out debugger stabs for me to read.  These were much
easier to parse.  It's still not a pretty program, but at least it's more
robust.
.PP
Pstruct takes any .c or .h files, or preferably .s ones, since that's
the format it is going to massage them into anyway, and spits out
listings like this:
.PP

Actually, this was generated by a particular set of options.  You can control
the formatting of each column, whether you prefer wide or fat, hex or decimal,
leading zeroes or whatever.
.PP
All you need to be able to use this is a C compiler than generates
BSD/GCC\-style stabs.  The \fB\-g\fR option on native BSD compilers and GCC
should get this for you.
.PP
To learn more, just type a bogus option, like \fB\-\e?\fR, and a long usage message
will be provided.  There are a fair number of possibilities.
.PP
If you're only a C programmer, than this is the end of the message for you.
You can quit right now, and if you care to, save off the source and run it
when you feel like it.  Or not.
.PP
But if you're a perl programmer, then for you I have something much more
wondrous than just a structure offset printer.
.PP
You see, if you call pstruct by its other incybernation, c2ph, you have a code
generator that translates C code into perl code!  Well, structure and union
declarations at least, but that's quite a bit.
.PP
Prior to this point, anyone programming in perl who wanted to interact
with C programs, like the kernel, was forced to guess the layouts of
the C strutures, and then hardwire these into his program.  Of course,
when you took your wonderfully crafted program to a system where the
sgtty structure was laid out differently, you program broke.  Which is
a shame.
.PP
We've had Larry's h2ph translator, which helped, but that only works on
cpp symbols, not real C, which was also very much needed.  What I offer
you is a symbolic way of getting at all the C structures.  I've couched
them in terms of packages and functions.  Consider the following program:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    #!/usr/local/bin/perl
.Ve
.Vb 3
\&    require 'syscall.ph';
\&    require 'sys/time.ph';
\&    require 'sys/resource.ph';
.Ve
.Vb 1
\&    $ru = "\e0" x &rusage'sizeof();
.Ve
.Vb 1
\&    syscall(&SYS_getrusage, &RUSAGE_SELF, $ru)      && die "getrusage: $!";
.Ve
.Vb 1
\&    @ru = unpack($t = &rusage'typedef(), $ru);
.Ve
.Vb 2
\&    $utime =  $ru[ &rusage'ru_utime + &timeval'tv_sec  ]
\&           + ($ru[ &rusage'ru_utime + &timeval'tv_usec ]) / 1e6;
.Ve
.Vb 2
\&    $stime =  $ru[ &rusage'ru_stime + &timeval'tv_sec  ]
\&           + ($ru[ &rusage'ru_stime + &timeval'tv_usec ]) / 1e6;
.Ve
.Vb 1
\&    printf "you have used %8.3fs+%8.3fu seconds.\en", $utime, $stime;
.Ve
As you see, the name of the package is the name of the structure.  Regular
fields are just their own names.  Plus the following accessor functions are
provided for your convenience:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    struct      This takes no arguments, and is merely the number of first-level
\&                elements in the structure.  You would use this for indexing
\&                into arrays of structures, perhaps like this
.Ve
.Vb 5
\&                    $usec = $u[ &user'u_utimer
\&                                + (&ITIMER_VIRTUAL * &itimerval'struct)
\&                                + &itimerval'it_value
\&                                + &timeval'tv_usec
\&                              ];
.Ve
.Vb 2
\&    sizeof      Returns the bytes in the structure, or the member if
\&                you pass it an argument, such as
.Ve
.Vb 1
\&                        &rusage'sizeof(&rusage'ru_utime)
.Ve
.Vb 6
\&    typedef     This is the perl format definition for passing to pack and
\&                unpack.  If you ask for the typedef of a nothing, you get
\&                the whole structure, otherwise you get that of the member
\&                you ask for.  Padding is taken care of, as is the magic to
\&                guarantee that a union is unpacked into all its aliases.
\&                Bitfields are not quite yet supported however.
.Ve
.Vb 4
\&    offsetof    This function is the byte offset into the array of that
\&                member.  You may wish to use this for indexing directly
\&                into the packed structure with vec() if you're too lazy
\&                to unpack it.
.Ve
.Vb 6
\&    typeof      Not to be confused with the typedef accessor function, this
\&                one returns the C type of that field.  This would allow
\&                you to print out a nice structured pretty print of some
\&                structure without knoning anything about it beforehand.
\&                No args to this one is a noop.  Someday I'll post such
\&                a thing to dump out your u structure for you.
.Ve
The way I see this being used is like basically this:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        % h2ph <some_include_file.h  >  /usr/lib/perl/tmp.ph
\&        % c2ph  some_include_file.h  >> /usr/lib/perl/tmp.ph
\&        % install
.Ve
It's a little tricker with c2ph because you have to get the includes right.
I can't know this for your system, but it's not usually too terribly difficult.
.PP
The code isn't pretty as I mentioned  -- I never thought it would be a 1000-
line program when I started, or I might not have begun. :\-)  But I would have
been less cavalier in how the parts of the program communicated with each
other, etc.  It might also have helped if I didn't have to divine the makeup
of the stabs on the fly, and then account for micro differences between my
compiler and gcc.
.PP
Anyway, here it is.  Should run on perl v4 or greater.  Maybe less.
